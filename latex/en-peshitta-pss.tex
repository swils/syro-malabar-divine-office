\slota{Make us worthy, our Lord and God, that we may act (\translationoption{be led})  in a virtuous conduct which pleases Your Majesty, and that our will may be in Your law, and that we may meditate on it day and night, Lord of all, Father...}

\marmita{1}

\psalm{1}

\begin{normalparskip}
Blessed is the man who has not walked in the way of the wicked,~\sep\ nor stood alongside the manner of thinking of sinners,~\sep

\qanona{Blessed is the one, Lord, who bears Your yoke and meditates on Your law day and night.}

nor sat at the seat of scoffers.~\sep

But his delight (\translationoption{desire}) is in the law of the Lord;~\sep\ and he will meditate on His law day and night.~\sep

He will be like a tree planted near a stream of water~\sep\ that yields (\translationoption{gives}) its fruit in its time; and whose leaves do not drop off.~\sep\ and everything that he does he brings to completion.~\sep

Not so are the wicked.~\sep\ But they are like chaff that the wind scatters.~\sep

Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,~\sep\ nor will sinners in the assembly of the righteous.~\sep

For the Lord knows the way of the righteous;~\sep\ but the way of the wicked will perish.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{2}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Why were the peoples in uproar (\translationoption{did the peoples rage})~\sep\ and the nations meditating on vanity?~\sep

  \qanona{Like horses without discernment, the arrogant raged and crucified the Messiah.}

  The kings of the earth (\translationoption{land}) and the rulers have arisen~\sep\ and have taken counsel together~\sep\ against the Lord and against His anointed One, [saying],~\sep

  ``Let us cut off their bonds;~\sep\ let us loosen their yoke from us!''~\sep

  The One who sits in the heavens will laugh;~\sep\ and the Lord will deride them.~\sep
  Then He will speak against them in His anger;~\sep\ in His rage He will terrify them.~\sep

  ``I have established My king upon Zion, My holy mountain,~\sep

  So that he might tell of My covenant''.~\sep\ The Lord said to me, You are My son;~\sep\ and this day I have begotten you.~\sep

  Ask from Me; I will give you~\sep\ the peoples as your inheritance,~\sep\ and the ends of the earth as your possessions.~\sep

  You will rule (\translationoption{shepherd}) them with an iron rod;~\sep\ and like a potter's vessels you will shatter them in pieces.~\sep

  Now, kings, be wise;~\sep\ be well instructed (\translationoption{accept discipline}), judges of the earth (\translationoption{land}).~\sep

  Serve the Lord with reverence;~\sep\ lay hold of Him with trembling.~\sep

  Kiss the son\footnote{Psalterium Pianum: ``show Him obedience.''}, lest He become angry~\sep\ and you perish from His way.~\sep\ For His anger is kindled a little (\translationoption{for a short while}).~\sep\ and blessed are all those who trust in Him.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{3}

\begin{normalparskip}
  O Lord, how my oppressors have increased!~\sep\ Many are those who have risen up against me!~\sep

  \qanona{As I spoke about Your truth, our Lord, the wicked rose against me, save me from their violence.}

  Many are those who say to my soul,~\sep\ ``You have no salvation (\translationoption{deliverance}) in your God''.~\sep

  But you, O Lord, are my helper and my glory~\sep\ and the One who lifts up my head.~\sep

  With my voice I cried out to the Lord;~\sep\ He answered me from His holy mountain.~\sep

  I lay down and slept, and I awoke,~\sep\ for the Lord has sustained me.~\sep

  I will not fear from ten thousands of people~\sep\ who surround me and attack me.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord my God, and rescue me!~\sep

  For you have struck all my enemies on their cheeks;~\sep\ You have broken the teeth of the wicked.~\sep

  Salvation is of the Lord.~\sep\ May Your blessing be upon Your people forever.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{4}

\begin{normalparskip}
  When I cried out to You, You answered me,~\sep\ O my God and defender (\translationoption{saviour}) of my righteousness.~\sep

  \qanona{There is none like the Lord, in whom I have trusted. He rescues me from the snares and wiles of the evil ones.}

  And in my afflictions You brought relief to me.~\sep\ Have mercy upon me and hear my prayer.~\sep

  Sons of men, how long~\sep\ will you cover My glory~\sep\ and love vanity~\sep\ and seek falsehood? Forever?~\sep

  Know that the Lord has set apart the chosen one for Himself in a wonderful way;~\sep\ the Lord will hear when I cry to Him.~\sep

  Be angry and do not sin.~\sep\ Speak in your hearts and meditate on your beds.~\sep

  Offer righteous sacrifices and trust in the Lord.~\sep

  Many are those who say, ‘Who will show us the good One (\translationoption{a good person, thing})?~\sep\ and shed (\translationoption{spread}) over us the light of His (\translationoption{his}) face?~\sep

  Lord, You have put (\translationoption{given}) Your joy in my heart~\sep\ from the times that their corn (\translationoption{crop}) and their wine and their oil~\sep\ increased in peace together.~\sep

  I will lie down and sleep,~\sep\ for You, O Lord, cause me to dwell alone in safety.
\end{normalparskip}

\slota{Hear the words of our prayers, my Lord, incline Your ear to the sound of our crying; and turn not Your face from the sound of our beseeching, o good One, in whom we put our confidence at all seasons and times, Lord of all...}

\marmita{2}

\psalm{5}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Give ear to my words, O Lord; and consider my meditation.~\sep

  Give ear to the sound of my call, my King and my God,~\sep

  \qanona{You have corrected me, Lord, in order to make me wise; do not reject my request.}

  for it is to You that I pray.~\sep

  O Lord, in the morning You hear my voice (\translationoption{call});~\sep\ in the morning I prepare myself and appear before You.~\sep

  For You are God, and You have no pleasure in wickedness;~\sep\ no evil one will dwell with You.~\sep

  Boastful people cannot stand before Your eyes;~\sep\ You hate all workers of falsehood.~\sep

  You will destroy those who speak falsehood;~\sep\ the Lord will despise (\translationoption{abhor, reject}) the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.~\sep

  But I, in Your abundant grace, will enter Your house;~\sep\ I will worship in Your holy temple.~\sep

  Lead me in Your fear and in Your righteousness, O Lord;~\sep\ because of my enemies make Your way straight before me.~\sep

  For justice is not in their mouth;~\sep\ but iniquity is in their midst.~\sep\ and their throats are like open graves;~\sep\ their tongues are perverted.~\sep

  Condemn them, O God;~\sep\ may they fall by their own counsels (\translationoption{away from their promises}).~\sep\ Because of the multitude of their iniquity cast them out,~\sep\ for they have provoked You to anger.~\sep

  May all those who hope in You be glad;~\sep\ may they praise You forever. And may You dwell among them;~\sep\ may all those who love Your Name be strengthened in You.~\sep

  For You will bless the righteous;~\sep\ O Lord, You will clothe me like a gracious (\translationoption{acceptable}) shield.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{6}

\begin{normalparskip}
  O Lord, do not censure me in Your anger;~\sep\ and do not chastise me in your wrath.~\sep

  \qanona{Have mercy on my weakness; my Creator, and in Your love chastise me.}

  Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am sick (\translationoption{weak});~\sep\ heal me, O Lord, for my bones tremble.~\sep

  And my soul is very troubled;~\sep\ but You, O Lord, how long?~\sep

  Return, O Lord, and deliver my soul;~\sep\ and rescue me because of Your grace.~\sep

  For in death there is no remembrance of You;~\sep\ in Sheol who gives You thanks?~\sep

  I am weary by my groanings and all night long I drench my bed;~\sep\ I make my bed wet with my tears.~\sep

  My eye is pained (\translationoption{grieved}) from anger;~\sep\ I am agitated because of all my enemies.~\sep

  Depart from me, all practitioners of falsehood,~\sep\ for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.~\sep

  The Lord has heard my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer.~\sep

  May all my enemies be very ashamed and broken;~\sep\ may they turn back and suddenly be destroyed.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{7}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Lord my God, in You I have put my trust; save me!~\sep\ and deliver me from all those who pursue me,~\sep

  \qanona{Blessed be God, who corrects and consoles His servants.}

  lest they tear my soul apart like a lion~\sep\ and there is no one who saves and delivers.~\sep

  O Lord my God, if I have done this~\sep\ and if there is iniquity on my hands,~\sep

  and if I have requited the one who has done evil to me,~\sep\ and if I have oppressed my enemy without cause,~\sep

  may my enemy pursue my soul and overtake it;~\sep\ and may he trample my life in the ground;~\sep\ and may he make my glory dwell in the dust.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord, in Your anger;~\sep\ and be exalted over the neck of my enemies,~\sep\ and watch (\translationoption{be aroused}) over me in the judgment that You have commanded.~\sep

  May the assembly of the nations gather around You;~\sep\ on behalf of them may You return on high.~\sep

  May the Lord judge the peoples;~\sep\ judge me, Lord, according to my righteousness and my integrity.~\sep

  May evil be accomplished upon the wicked;~\sep\ but may You establish the righteous,~\sep\ You who examines the heart and the reins.~\sep

  The righteous God upholds (\translationoption{helps}) me,~\sep\ God, who saves the upright of heart.~\sep

  God is a fair Judge (\translationoption{Judge of truth}),~\sep\ and He is not angry every day.~\sep

  If He does not turn back (\translationoption{changes}), He sharpens his sword, and He stretches out His bow.~\sep

  He has prepared and is preparing for Himself instruments (\translationoption{vessels}) of anger;~\sep\ He made His arrows fiery ones (\translationoption{He has made ready His arrows against those that burn [with envy]})\footnote{Translation recommended by S. Brock; Taylor: ``He has made ready his flaming arrows''; Psalterium Pianum: ``He will make His arrows fiery''.}.~\sep

  For the wicked is in travail, and he has conceived falsehood and given birth to deceit.~\sep

  He made a well and dug it out;~\sep\ and he fell into the pit that he made.~\sep

  His iniquity will return on his own head;~\sep\ his iniquity will come down on the crown of his head.~\sep

  I will praise the Lord according to my righteousness;~\sep\ and I will sing to the Name of the Lord most High.
\end{normalparskip}

\slota{Slota: We are bound to confess, worship and glorify You, Lord our Lord, hidden in Your Being, who from the mouth of boys and children have established Your glory, at all seasons and times, Lord of all...}

\marmita{3}

\psalm{8}

\begin{normalparskip}
  O Lord, our Lord,~\sep\ how glorious is Your Name in all the earth!~\sep\ For you have set Your glory above the heavens.~\sep

  \qanona{Son, whom the children praised in Jerusalem with their Hosanna's, we ask You, save those who worship You.}

  From the mouth of the young and of children~\sep\ You have established Your glory~\sep

  because of Your enemies,~\sep\ so that the enemy who takes vengeance might be brought to naught.~\sep

  For they have seen Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,~\sep\ the moon and the stars that You have established.~\sep

  What is man that You have remembered him?~\sep\ Or the son of man, that You have visited (\translationoption{took care for}) him?~\sep

  You made him a little less than the angels;~\sep\ You clothed him with honour and glory.~\sep

  You gave him authority over the work of Your hands;~\sep\ and You placed everything under his feet:~\sep

  all sheep and cattle,~\sep\ even the animals of the field, and the birds that are in the sky,~\sep

  and the fish of the sea that travel along in the paths of the seas.~\sep

  O Lord, our Lord, how glorious is Your Name in all the earth!
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{9}

\begin{normalparskip}
  I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart;~\sep\ I will recount all Your wonders.~\sep

  \qanona{We give You thanks, for in Your mercy You have turned us to Your knowledge; let our adversaries be put to confusion.}

  I will be glad and exult in You;~\sep\ and I will sing to Your Name, O Most High.~\sep

  When my enemies turn backwards,~\sep\ they stumble and perish before You.~\sep

  For You have brought about my retribution (\translationoption{reward}) and my verdict (\translationoption{judgment});~\sep\ You are seated upon the throne as the righteous Judge.~\sep

  You have rebuked the peoples and You have destroyed the wicked.~\sep\ You have blotted out their names forever and ever.~\sep

  My enemies are consumed by the sword forever;~\sep\ You have uprooted cities and destroyed their memory.~\sep

  The Lord abides forever;~\sep\ and He establishes His throne for judgment,~\sep

  so that He might judge the world in truth;~\sep\ and the peoples in righteousness.~\sep

  The Lord is a refuge for the poor~\sep\ and their helper in times of distress.~\sep

  All those who know Your Name will put trust in You,~\sep\ for You, O Lord, do not abandon those who seek You.~\sep

  Sing to the Lord, who dwells in Zion;~\sep\ and declare His deeds among the peoples.~\sep

  For He remembers to avenge their blood;~\sep\ and He does not forget the cry of the poor.~\sep

  Have mercy on me, O Lord;~\sep\ see my subjection at the hands of those who hate me,~\sep\ You who raise me up from the gates of death,~\sep

  so that I may declare all Your wonders~\sep\ in the gates of daughter Zion,~\sep\ I will exult in Your salvation.~\sep

  The peoples have sunk into the pit that they made;~\sep\ their feet have been caught in the snare (\translationoption{net}) that they concealed.~\sep

  The Lord makes known the judgment that He executes;~\sep\ the wicked is caught by the work of his own hands.~\sep

  The wicked will return to Sheol,~\sep\ and all the peoples who forget God.~\sep

  For the poor are not forgotten forever;~\sep\ and You will not do away with the hope of the poor forever.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord, and let no(t) man prevail;~\sep\ let the peoples be judged in Your sight.~\sep

  Appoint for them a lawgiver,~\sep\ so that the peoples may know that they are only men.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{10}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Why, O Lord, do You stand far away~\sep\ and turn away your eyes (\translationoption{attention}) in times of distress?~\sep

  \qanona{Since the wicked laid ambushes for (\translationoption{acted treacherously towards}) the just and desecrate Your Name, destroy, my Lord, their plotting!}

  Through the pride of the wicked the poor is consumed;~\sep\ may they be ensnared by the plan that they have devised.~\sep

  For the wicked boasts in the desires of his soul;~\sep\ the wicked is [called] blessed, but the Lord is angry.~\sep\ The wicked in his haughtiness does not make any inquiry;~\sep\ God is not in any of his thoughts.~\sep

  His ways are always profane;~\sep\ Your judgment is exalted above his awareness.~\sep\ and he treats all his enemies with contempt.~\sep

  He says in his heart, I will not be shaken throughout all generations.~\sep

  He meditates on evil and his mouth is full of cursing;~\sep\ fraud and deceit are under his tongue, iniquity and depravity.~\sep

  He sits in ambush at the dwelling,~\sep\ and in secret he slays the righteous,~\sep\ his eyes gaze on the poor.~\sep

  He lies in ambush to do violence to (\translationoption{to snare}) the poor by the torment of his snare (\translationoption{in the drawing of his net}).~\sep

  He will be humbled and fall;~\sep\ and sickness and pain are in his bones.~\sep

  He says in his heart, ``God is unmindful (\translationoption{has forgotten});~\sep\ He has turned away His face and never sees''.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord my God, and lift up Your hand;~\sep\ do not be unmindful of (\translationoption{forget not}) the poor.~\sep

  Why does the sinner provoke God to anger~\sep\ and say in his heart, ``He does not avenge''?~\sep

  You see that there is injustice and wrath;~\sep\ and You consider that he will be given up into Your hands.~\sep\ The poor will be abandoned (\translationoption{commit himself}) to You;~\sep\ and You are the Helper of the orphan.~\sep

  Break the arm of the sinner and of the wicked;~\sep\ may his sin seek him, and may he not be found.~\sep

  The Lord is King forever and ever;~\sep\ the heathen have perished from His land.~\sep

  You, O Lord, hear the hope of the poor;~\sep\ and Your ear inclines to the preparation of their heart,~\sep

  to administer justice for the orphans and the needy,~\sep\ so that he (\translationoption{He?}) not again destroy men from the earth.

\begin{normalparskip}
  In the Lord I trust. How can you say to my soul,~\sep\ ‘Flee and dwell upon the mountains like a bird.~\sep

  \qanona{The sinners have deceived me; I have trusted in You, Lord!}

  For look! Sinners have drawn the bow;~\sep\ and they have prepared their arrows on the bow-string~\sep\ to shoot in the darkness at the upright of heart.~\sep

  For that which You made ready they have overthrown;~\sep\ but what is the righteous going to do?~\sep

  The Lord is in His holy temple;~\sep\ the Lord's throne is in the heavens.~\sep\ His eyes see; and His eyelids examine the sons of men.~\sep

  The Lord examines the righteous and the wicked;~\sep\ and He hates those who love iniquity.~\sep

  Snares have come down on the wicked like rain;~\sep\ fire and brimstone~\sep\ and an afflicting wind are the portion of their cup.~\sep

  For the Lord is righteous, and He loves righteousness,~\sep\ and His face beholds uprightness.

\psalm{12}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Save, O Lord, for the good became extinct (\translationoption{there is no good one left});~\sep\ and faith (\translationoption{truth}) has vanished from (\translationoption{ceased upon}) the earth.~\sep

  \qanona{Deceit has increased and love has decreased; do not turn away from us, Messiah!}

  Men speak vanity;~\sep\ and a man with his neighbour with divisive lips,~\sep\ heart to heart he speaks\footnote{Translation of Fr. Ephraim Ashur Alkhas, a scholarly Assyrian priest; A. Oliver: ``with a double heart''; R.A. Taylor: ``secretly, lit. In the heart and in the heart''.}.~\sep

  May the Lord destroy all divisive lips~\sep\ and tongues that speak haughtily (\translationoption{boastful things}).~\sep

  They say, ``We will magnify our tongue.~\sep\ and: Our lips belong to us; who is Lord over us''?~\sep

  Because of the spoil of the poor and the groan of the needy,~\sep\ ``I will therefore (\translationoption{now}) arise'', says the Lord.~\sep\ ``I will openly execute deliverance''.~\sep

  The word of the Lord is a pure word;~\sep\ it is choice silver that has been proven in the earth~\sep\ and refined seven times.~\sep

  You, O Lord, will keep them;~\sep\ deliver me and save me from this generation forever.~\sep

  For the wicked walk all around~\sep\ according to the base haughtiness of the sons of Edom.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{13}

\begin{normalparskip}
  How long will you forget me, O Lord? Forever?~\sep\ How long will You turn away Your face from me?~\sep

  \qanona{Be reconciled with me, Lord and save me, so that I may praise You.}

  How long will You put sorrow in my soul,~\sep\ and misery in my heart every day?~\sep\ How long will my enemy be exalted over me?~\sep

  Look and answer (\translationoption{hear}) me, O Lord my God;~\sep\ and illumine my eyes, lest I sleep in death.~\sep

  May my enemy not say, I have overcome him;~\sep\ nor may my oppressors rejoice over me when I am shaken.~\sep

  But I trust in Your grace;~\sep\ may my heart rejoice in Your salvation.~\sep

  I will praise the Lord who has saved me.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{14}

\begin{normalparskip}
  The wicked says in his heart, ``There is no God''.~\sep\ They are corrupt and defiled in their contrivances;~\sep

  \qanona{Rescue Your Church from the evil ones, Lord of all creatures!}

  there is no one who does good.~\sep

  The Lord looks out from the heavens on the sons of men,~\sep\ to see if there is anyone who understands and seeks God.~\sep

  All of them have gone astray (\translationoption{turned away}) altogether and are rejected;~\sep\ there is none who does good, not even one.~\sep

  All of the workers of iniquity lack understanding;~\sep\ they devour my people as though eating bread.~\sep\ They have not cried out to the Lord.~\sep

  They greatly feared there,~\sep\ for God is in the generation of the righteous.~\sep

  They have dishonoured the thinking of the poor,~\sep\ because the Lord is his confidence.~\sep

  Who will impart salvation to Israel from Zion?~\sep\ When the Lord restores the captivity of His people, may Jacob rejoice, and may Israel be glad!

\begin{normalparskip}
  Lord, who may dwell in Your sanctuary?~\sep\ Who may reside on Your holy mountain?~\sep

  \qanona{Make me stand in purity of thoughts before Your sacred altar, Lord.}

  The one who walks blamelessly and who practices (\translationoption{does}) righteousness,~\sep\ who speaks the truth in his heart, and who is without deceit in his tongue,~\sep

  who does not inflict harm on his friend,~\sep\ who does not accept a bribe against his neighbour,~\sep

  In whose eyes provokers are despised.~\sep\ Instead, he honours those who fear the Lord;~\sep\ he takes an oath with his friend and does not deceive;~\sep

  he does not lend (\translationliteral{gives}) his money with interest,~\sep\ and he does not accept a bribe against the innocent.~\sep\ Whoever does these things is just;~\sep\ he will never be shaken.

\psalm{16}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Preserve me, O God, for I trust in You.~\sep\ I said to the Lord, ``You are my Lord;~\sep

  my goodness (\translationoption{prosperity}) is from You''.~\sep

  also for the saints who are on earth (\translationoption{the land}) and the praiseworthy,~\sep\ in whom is all my delight.~\sep

  Their latter pains will increase quickly\footnote{Psalterium Pianum adds: those who follow strange gods.}~\sep\ I will not pour out their libations of blood.~\sep\ I will not mention their names with my lips.~\sep

  The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup;~\sep\ You restore to me my inheritance.~\sep

  The measuring lines\footnote{The cord of the land surveyor who divides the lands and measures out a lot of land for each.} have fallen to me in the best of places,~\sep\ also my inheritance is attractive to me.~\sep

  I will bless the Lord who counsels me;~\sep\ my reins also during the night instruct (\translationoption{chasten}) me.~\sep

  I have set the Lord before me at all times;~\sep\ He is at my right hand, so that I will not tremble.~\sep

  Therefore my heart rejoices and my glory exults;~\sep\ my flesh also will dwell securely.~\sep

  For You have not left my soul in Sheol;~\sep\ You have not allowed Your holy one to see corruption.~\sep

  You will show me Your path of life;~\sep\ I will be satisfied with the joy of Your face (\translationoption{presence})~\sep\ and with the gladness (\translationoption{pleasantness}) of the victory of Your right hand.

  Listen, O holy Lord, and consider my petition;~\sep\ give ear to my prayer, for it does not (come) from fraudulent lips.~\sep

  \qanona{My Lord and my God, have mercy on me; for I am persecuted unjustly!}

  May my vindication (\translationoption{judgment}) come from Your presence;~\sep\ may Your eyes see what is upright.~\sep

  You have searched my heart; and You have visited (\translationoption{inspected}) me at night.~\sep\ and You have examined me; and You did not find iniquity in me.~\sep\ The deeds of men have not crossed my mouth.~\sep

  By the word of Your lips,~\sep\ however, You have kept me from evil ways.~\sep

  You have sustained my walking in Your paths, so that my footsteps might not totter.~\sep

  I cry to You, for You answer me.~\sep\ O God, incline Your ear to me; listen to my words.~\sep

  Make Your holy one a wonder~\sep\ and a redeemer for those who trust (in You)~\sep\ from those who stand up against Your right hand.~\sep

  Keep me as the pupil of the eye;~\sep\ hide me in the shadow of Your wings~\sep

  from these sinners who plunder me~\sep\ and the enemies of my soul who oppose me.~\sep

  Shut (\translationoption{stop up}) the mouth of those who speak boastfulness.~\sep

  They praised me, but now they have surrounded me.~\sep\ They have set their eyes, so that they might hurl me on the ground.~\sep

  They are like a lion that seeks to tear,~\sep\ like a lion’s whelp that crouches in concealment.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord, before them, and make them bow;~\sep\ deliver my soul from the wicked and from the sword.~\sep

  From the dead who die at Your hands, O Lord,~\sep\ and from the dead of the grave~\sep\ may You divide them in life.~\sep\ Fill their bellies with Your treasures;~\sep\ may their children be filled, and may they leave the remainder to their children.~\sep

  I love You, Lord, my strength and my confidence,~\sep\ my refuge and my deliverer,~\sep

  the strong God in whom I trust,~\sep\ my helper and the horn of my salvation,~\sep\ my glorious refuge.~\sep

  I will call to the Lord, and I will be saved from my enemies.~\sep

  For the pains of death surrounded me;~\sep\ and the feet of evildoers troubled me.~\sep

  The pains of Sheol surrounded me;~\sep\ the snares of death preceded me.~\sep

  In my distress I called to the Lord; and I called to God.~\sep\ He heard my voice from His temple;~\sep\ and my cry (\translationoption{bellowing}) before Him entered His ears.~\sep

  The earth shook and trembled;~\sep\ the foundations of the mountains trembled and burst asunder,~\sep\ because He was furious over them.~\sep

  Smoke went up in His anger,~\sep\ and fire from His countenance was inflamed,~\sep\ and coals blazed from it.~\sep

  He lowered the heavens and came down;~\sep\ and thick darkness was under His feet.~\sep

  He rode on the cherubim and flew;~\sep\ and He flew on the wings of the wind.~\sep

  He put the darkness as His shelter; and His tabernacle surrounded Him,~\sep\ the darkness of water in the clouds of the air.~\sep

  From the brightness of His tabernacle~\sep\ He made His clouds hailstones and burning coals of fire.~\sep

  The Lord thundered in the heavens;~\sep\ the Most High sounded forth (\translationliteral{gave}) His voice,~\sep\ hailstones and coals of fire.~\sep

  He sent forth His arrows and scattered them;~\sep\ He increased His lightnings and agitated them.~\sep

  The springs of water were visible (\translationoption{seen});~\sep\ and the foundations of the earth were uncovered~\sep\ by Your rebuke, O Lord,~\sep\ and by the breath of the wind of Your anger.~\sep

  He sent from on high and drew me out;~\sep\ and He received me from many waters.~\sep

  He delivered me from my powerful enemies,~\sep\ from my adversaries who were stronger than I.~\sep

  They went before me in the day of my adversities;~\sep\ but the Lord was my Saviour (\translationoption{a Saviour for me}).~\sep

  He brought me to an open space;~\sep\ He delivered me because He took pleasure in me.~\sep

  God is the One who has girded me with strength;~\sep\ He has made (\translationliteral{gave}) my way blameless.~\sep

  He has made my feet like those of a deer; and He has established me on the height.~\sep

  You have given me the shield of salvation;~\sep\ Your right hand will uphold me, and Your instruction (\translationoption{correction}) will educate me.~\sep

  You have made my steps wide beneath me, so that my ankles might not totter.~\sep

  I will pursue my enemies and overtake them;~\sep\ I will not turn aside until I destroyed (\translationoption{put an end to}) them.~\sep

  I will strike them, and they will not be able to rise;~\sep\ they will fall beneath my feet.~\sep

  You will gird me with strength for the battle;~\sep\ and You will bring those who oppose (\translationliteral{those standing against me}) me to their knees beneath me.~\sep

  You will shatter (\translationoption{break}) my enemies before me;~\sep\ and I will silence my enemies.~\sep

  They will call out, but there will be no saviour for them;~\sep\ they will beseech the Lord, but He will not answer them.~\sep

  I will pulverize them like dust carried along by the wind (\translationliteral{upon the face of the wind});~\sep\ I will trample them like the mud in (\translationliteral{of}) the markets (\translationoption{streets}).~\sep

  You will deliver me from the judgments of the people;~\sep\ You will make me the head of peoples.~\sep\ A people that I have not known will serve me.~\sep

  Obediently (\translationliteral{Hearing of the ear}) they will listen to me; (sons of) foreigners will subject to me.~\sep

  The (son of the) foreigners will be restrained;~\sep\ they will fall lame from their paths.~\sep

  The Lord lives, and blessed be the One who strengthens me!~\sep\ Exalted is my God and my Saviour!~\sep

  It is God who has granted me vengeance;~\sep\ and He has subdued the peoples under me.~\sep

  He has delivered me from my enemies;~\sep\ He has exalted (\translationoption{set up}) me over those who stand against me.~\sep\ From wicked men You will deliver me.~\sep

  Therefore I will give You thanks among the peoples, my Lord;~\sep\ I will sing to Your Name. He magnifies the salvation of His king;~\sep\ He shows grace to His anointed,~\sep\ to David and to his descendants (\translationliteral{his seed}) forever.

  You have sold Your people without price;~\sep\ and you have not increased (\translationoption{made more}) by their exchange.~\sep

  You have made us a reproach to our neighbours,~\sep\ and a mocking and a laughing-stock to those who surround us.~\sep

  You made us a proverb among the peoples,~\sep\ and a shaking of the head among the nations.~\sep

  All day long my shame is before me;~\sep\ and the shame of my face has covered me.~\sep

  because of the voice of the reviler and blasphemer~\sep\ and because of the enemy who takes revenge.~\sep

  All these things have befallen us; but we have not forgotten You.~\sep\ We have not been unfaithful to Your covenant.~\sep

  We have not turned back;~\sep\ and we have not turned our ways from Your path.~\sep

  For You have humbled us with a secondary place;~\sep\ You have covered us with the shadows of death.~\sep

  But we have not forgotten the Name of our God;~\sep\ we have not extended our hands to foreign gods.~\sep

  God is the One searching this out,~\sep\ for He knows the thought (\translationoption{intentions}) of the heart.~\sep

  For Your sake we are killed all day;~\sep\ and we are considered as sheep for the slaughter.~\sep

  Awake! Do not sleep, O Lord!~\sep\ Call us to mind, and do not forget us.~\sep

  Do not turn away Your face from us;~\sep\ and do not forget our humiliation and our afflictions.~\sep

  For our soul has slept in the dust;~\sep\ and our belly has stuck to the ground.~\sep

  Arise, help us! And save us because of Your mercies!

\psalm{45}

\begin{normalparskip}
  My heart overflows (\translationoption{pours forth}) with good words;~\sep\ I will speak of my handiwork to the king.~\sep

  \qanona{Glory to You, our Saviour for You honoured Your Church, the chosen one, and adorned her with all beauties.}

  My tongue is the pen of a skilful scribe.~\sep

  He is fairer in his appearance than the (other) children of men;~\sep\ mercies are poured out on your lips,~\sep\ for this reason God has blessed you forever.~\sep

  Gird the sword on your thighs, mighty man,~\sep\ your honour and your glory. Your glory is victorious (\translationoption{triumphs});~\sep\ ride forth on the word of truth, and the meekness of righteousness.~\sep\ Your law is in the fear of your right hand.~\sep

  Your arrows are sharp; and the peoples will fall beneath you,~\sep\ in the midst (\translationliteral{heart}) of the enemies of the king.~\sep

  Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;~\sep\ an upright sceptre is the sceptre of Your kingdom.~\sep

  You love righteousness and hate iniquity;~\sep\ on account of this, God, your God, has anointed you~\sep\ with the oil of gladness above your companions.~\sep

  With myrrh and cassia and stacte~\sep\ are all your garments fragrant.~\sep\ From the finest palace from my presence (\translationoption{house}) they have made you glad.~\sep

  The daughter of the king stands in glory;~\sep\ and the queen is at your right hand~\sep\ in clothing of the gold of Ophir.~\sep

  Listen, my daughter, and consider, and incline your ear,~\sep\ forget your people and your father's house,~\sep

  so that the king may earnestly desire your beauty.~\sep\ Reverence him, for he is your lord.~\sep

  The daughter of Tyre will reverence him;~\sep\ with offerings the rich of the people will seek your face.~\sep

  All the glory of the king's daughter is within;~\sep\ and her clothing is decorated with fine gold.~\sep

  With offerings she will come to the king;~\sep\ and they will bring her virgin companions after her.~\sep

  They will come in joy and gladness;~\sep\ they will enter the king's palace.~\sep

  In place of your fathers (\translationoption{ancestors}) there will be your children;~\sep\ make them rulers in all the land,~\sep

  so that your name may be remembered in every generation.~\sep\ For this reason the peoples will praise you forever and ever.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{46}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Our God is our strong Refuge~\sep\ and our Helper in times of affliction.~\sep

  \qanona{God, our invincible Helper, destroy the proud and make us glad with Your salvation.}

  You are always present for us;~\sep\ therefore we do not fear~\sep\ when the earth shakes and the mountains shake in the midst of the seas.~\sep

  Their waters may be disturbed and transformed;~\sep\ the mountains may be shaken by his might.~\sep

  Streams of rivers will cause gladness in the city of our God;~\sep\ the dwelling place of the Most High is holy.~\sep

  God is in her midst; she will not be shaken;~\sep\ God will help her at the break of day (\translationoption{very early}).~\sep

  The peoples are in an uproar and kingdoms shake;~\sep\ He raises His voice, and the earth shakes.~\sep

  The Lord almighty is with us;~\sep\ and the God of Jacob is our Helper.~\sep

  Come, see the works of God,~\sep\ who performs wonders in the earth.~\sep

  He causes wars to cease from the ends of the earth.~\sep\ He shatters bows and shatters spears;~\sep\ He burns chariots with fire.~\sep

  Turn and acknowledge (\translationoption{know}) that I am God;~\sep\ I am exalted among the peoples, and I am exalted throughout the earth.~\sep

  The Lord almighty is with us;~\sep\ the God of Jacob is our helper.

\slota{We are bound to confess, worship, and glorify You, excellent and glorious King, whose Majesty the nations and peoples, clapping their hands, worship, at all seasons and times, Lord of all...}

\marmita{18}

\psalm{47}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Clap your hands, all you peoples;~\sep\ and glorify God with the sound of praise.~\sep

  \qanona{Blessed is the One who came down and gave us His body for food and by His blood wiped out the debts of His flock!}

  For the Lord is Most High and awesome; He is the great king over all the earth,~\sep

  the One who subdues the peoples under us~\sep\ and the nations under our feet.~\sep

  He caused us to choose His inheritance, and the glory of Jacob whom He loved.~\sep

  God has gone up with praise; the Lord with the sound of the horn.~\sep

  Sing to God with praise; sing to our King.~\sep

  For God is King of all the earth; sing praise to Him.~\sep

  God reigns over the peoples;~\sep\ God sits on His holy throne.~\sep

  Turn to the God of Abraham, rulers of the peoples,~\sep\ for the powers of the earth belong to God, and He is greatly exalted.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{48}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Great is our Lord and greatly to be praised~\sep\ in the city of our God~\sep

  \qanona{Exult and rejoice, race of Adam, who was exalted in Jesus who has risen up and conquered death by His death.}

  and on his holy and glorious mountain.~\sep\ A joy in all the earth~\sep\ is mount Zion, which is on the borders of the north.~\sep\ It is the city of the great King.~\sep

  God is in her walled enclosures (\translationoption{palaces}),~\sep\ making known His strength.~\sep

  For look! Kings prepared themselves and passed by together.~\sep

  They saw and were amazed; and they tottered, and trembling seized them,~\sep\ and pangs like those of a woman giving birth.~\sep

  With a strong wind the ships of Tarshish will be broken.~\sep

  As we have heard, thus we have seen~\sep\ in the city of the Lord almighty,~\sep

  in the city of our God.~\sep\ God will establish her forever.~\sep

  We have hoped, O God, for Your kindness in the midst of Your temple.~\sep

  As is Your Name, O God, so are Your praises~\sep\ to the ends of the earth Your right hand is filled with righteousness.~\sep

  May mount Zion rejoice, and may the daughters of Judah be glad,~\sep\ because of Your judgments, O Lord.~\sep

  Walk around Zion and go around her; and count her towers.~\sep

  Mark well (\translationliteral{Place your heart upon}) her strength; and tear down her citadels (\translationoption{palaces}),~\sep\ so that you may declare to another generation.~\sep

  That this is God, our God,~\sep\ forever and ever;~\sep\ He will guide us beyond death.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{49}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Hear this, all you peoples;~\sep\ and give ear, all inhabitants of the earth (\translationoption{land}).~\sep

  \qanona{Hear now, rulers of the people: with fear, serve God, the Lord of all!}

  Those lowly and those exalted\footnote{\translationLiteral{Sons of the earth and sons of men.}},~\sep\ rich and poor together.~\sep

  My mouth will speak wisdom;~\sep\ and the meditation of my heart (will be of) understanding.~\sep

  I will incline my ears to proverbs;~\sep\ I will utter my riddles on the harp.~\sep

  I do not fear in the evil days;~\sep\ the wickedness of my enemies surrounds me;~\sep

  all those who trust in their own strength~\sep\ and boast in the multitude of their riches.~\sep

  A brother can (\translationliteral{does}) not deliver;~\sep\ a man can (\translationliteral{does}) not give to God for his redemption.~\sep

  Costly is the redemption of their soul.~\sep

  Labour forever, so that you may live forever and ever~\sep\ and not see corruption.~\sep

  Nonetheless, you see that wise men die;~\sep\ likewise the foolish and those lacking understanding perish,~\sep\ and they leave their belongings to others.~\sep

  Their graves are their abodes forever,~\sep\ and their dwelling places throughout generations,~\sep\ (yet) they assign names throughout the land.~\sep

  Man does not perceive (\translationoption{has not perceived}) his honour\footnote{I.e. the honour accorded him by God.}; but he is delivered over to the animals, and has become like them.~\sep

  This is their path, a stumbling block to their soul;~\sep\ and finally they will pasture with their mouth~\sep\ like sheep they will be delivered to Sheol;~\sep\ and death will devour them.~\sep

  The upright will have authority over them in the morning,~\sep\ and Sheol will consume their form;~\sep\ they will be removed (\translationoption{cast out}) from their glories.~\sep

  God will save my soul;~\sep\ and He will lift me up from the power (\translationliteral{hand}) of Sheol.~\sep

  Do not stand in awe when a man becomes rich,~\sep\ when the glory of his house increases.~\sep

  For he takes nothing at his death;~\sep\ nor does his glory go down after him.~\sep

  For he blesses his soul during his life;~\sep\ and he will praise You when You do him good.~\sep

  You will bring him to the generation of his fathers (\translationoption{ancestors});~\sep\ he will never see the light.~\sep

  Man does not perceive (\translationoption{has not perceived}) his honour,~\sep\ but he is delivered over to the animals~\sep\ and has become like them.
