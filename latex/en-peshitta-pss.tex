\slota{Make us worthy, our Lord and God, that we may act (\translationoption{be led})  in a virtuous conduct which pleases Your Majesty, and that our will may be in Your law, and that we may meditate on it day and night, Lord of all, Father...}

\marmita{1}

\psalm{1}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Blessed is the man who has not walked in the way of the wicked,~\sep\ nor stood alongside the manner of thinking of sinners,~\sep

  \qanona{Blessed is the one, Lord, who bears Your yoke and meditates on Your law day and night.}

  nor sat at the seat of scoffers.~\sep

  But his delight (\translationoption{desire}) is in the law of the Lord;~\sep\ and he will meditate on His law day and night.~\sep

  He will be like a tree planted near a stream of water~\sep\ that yields (\translationoption{gives}) its fruit in its time; and whose leaves do not drop off.~\sep\ and everything that he does he brings to completion.~\sep

  Not so are the wicked.~\sep\ But they are like chaff that the wind scatters.~\sep

  Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,~\sep\ nor will sinners in the assembly of the righteous.~\sep

  For the Lord knows the way of the righteous;~\sep\ but the way of the wicked will perish.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{2}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Why were the peoples in uproar (\translationoption{did the peoples rage})~\sep\ and the nations meditating on vanity?~\sep

  \qanona{Like horses without discernment, the arrogant raged and crucified the Messiah.}

  The kings of the earth (\translationoption{land}) and the rulers have arisen~\sep\ and have taken counsel together~\sep\ against the Lord and against His anointed One, [saying],~\sep

  ``Let us cut off their bonds;~\sep\ let us loosen their yoke from us!''~\sep

  The One who sits in the heavens will laugh;~\sep\ and the Lord will deride them.~\sep

  Then He will speak against them in His anger;~\sep\ in His rage He will terrify them.~\sep

  ``I have established My king upon Zion, My holy mountain,~\sep

  So that he might tell of My covenant''.~\sep\ The Lord said to me, You are My son;~\sep\ and this day I have begotten you.~\sep

  Ask from Me; I will give you~\sep\ the peoples as your inheritance,~\sep\ and the ends of the earth as your possessions.~\sep

  You will rule (\translationoption{shepherd}) them with an iron rod;~\sep\ and like a potter's vessels you will shatter them in pieces.~\sep

  Now, kings, be wise;~\sep\ be well instructed (\translationoption{accept discipline}), judges of the earth (\translationoption{land}).~\sep

  Serve the Lord with reverence;~\sep\ lay hold of Him with trembling.~\sep

  Kiss the son\footnote{Psalterium Pianum: ``show Him obedience.''}, lest He become angry~\sep\ and you perish from His way.~\sep\ For His anger is kindled a little (\translationoption{for a short while}).~\sep\ and blessed are all those who trust in Him.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{3}

\begin{normalparskip}
  O Lord, how my oppressors have increased!~\sep\ Many are those who have risen up against me!~\sep

  \qanona{As I spoke about Your truth, our Lord, the wicked rose against me, save me from their violence.}

  Many are those who say to my soul,~\sep\ ``You have no salvation (\translationoption{deliverance}) in your God''.~\sep

  But you, O Lord, are my helper and my glory~\sep\ and the One who lifts up my head.~\sep

  With my voice I cried out to the Lord;~\sep\ He answered me from His holy mountain.~\sep

  I lay down and slept, and I awoke,~\sep\ for the Lord has sustained me.~\sep

  I will not fear from ten thousands of people~\sep\ who surround me and attack me.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord my God, and rescue me!~\sep

  For you have struck all my enemies on their cheeks;~\sep\ You have broken the teeth of the wicked.~\sep

  Salvation is of the Lord.~\sep\ May Your blessing be upon Your people forever.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{4}

\begin{normalparskip}
  When I cried out to You, You answered me,~\sep\ O my God and defender (\translationoption{saviour}) of my righteousness.~\sep

  \qanona{There is none like the Lord, in whom I have trusted. He rescues me from the snares and wiles of the evil ones.}

  And in my afflictions You brought relief to me.~\sep\ Have mercy upon me and hear my prayer.~\sep

  Sons of men, how long~\sep\ will you cover My glory~\sep\ and love vanity~\sep\ and seek falsehood? Forever?~\sep

  Know that the Lord has set apart the chosen one for Himself in a wonderful way;~\sep\ the Lord will hear when I cry to Him.~\sep

  Be angry and do not sin.~\sep\ Speak in your hearts and meditate on your beds.~\sep

  Offer righteous sacrifices and trust in the Lord.~\sep

  Many are those who say, ‘Who will show us the good One (\translationoption{a good person, thing})?~\sep\ and shed (\translationoption{spread}) over us the light of His (\translationoption{his}) face?~\sep

  Lord, You have put (\translationoption{given}) Your joy in my heart~\sep\ from the times that their corn (\translationoption{crop}) and their wine and their oil~\sep\ increased in peace together.~\sep

  I will lie down and sleep,~\sep\ for You, O Lord, cause me to dwell alone in safety.
\end{normalparskip}

\slota{Hear the words of our prayers, my Lord, incline Your ear to the sound of our crying; and turn not Your face from the sound of our beseeching, o good One, in whom we put our confidence at all seasons and times, Lord of all...}

\marmita{2}

\psalm{5}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Give ear to my words, O Lord; and consider my meditation.~\sep

  Give ear to the sound of my call, my King and my God,~\sep

  \qanona{You have corrected me, Lord, in order to make me wise; do not reject my request.}

  for it is to You that I pray.~\sep

  O Lord, in the morning You hear my voice (\translationoption{call});~\sep\ in the morning I prepare myself and appear before You.~\sep

  For You are God, and You have no pleasure in wickedness;~\sep\ no evil one will dwell with You.~\sep

  Boastful people cannot stand before Your eyes;~\sep\ You hate all workers of falsehood.~\sep

  You will destroy those who speak falsehood;~\sep\ the Lord will despise (\translationoption{abhor, reject}) the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.~\sep

  But I, in Your abundant grace, will enter Your house;~\sep\ I will worship in Your holy temple.~\sep

  Lead me in Your fear and in Your righteousness, O Lord;~\sep\ because of my enemies make Your way straight before me.~\sep

  For justice is not in their mouth;~\sep\ but iniquity is in their midst.~\sep\ and their throats are like open graves;~\sep\ their tongues are perverted.~\sep

  Condemn them, O God;~\sep\ may they fall by their own counsels (\translationoption{away from their promises}).~\sep\ Because of the multitude of their iniquity cast them out,~\sep\ for they have provoked You to anger.~\sep

  May all those who hope in You be glad;~\sep\ may they praise You forever. And may You dwell among them;~\sep\ may all those who love Your Name be strengthened in You.~\sep

  For You will bless the righteous;~\sep\ O Lord, You will clothe me like a gracious (\translationoption{acceptable}) shield.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{6}

\begin{normalparskip}
  O Lord, do not censure me in Your anger;~\sep\ and do not chastise me in your wrath.~\sep

  \qanona{Have mercy on my weakness; my Creator, and in Your love chastise me.}

  Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am sick (\translationoption{weak});~\sep\ heal me, O Lord, for my bones tremble.~\sep

  And my soul is very troubled;~\sep\ but You, O Lord, how long?~\sep

  Return, O Lord, and deliver my soul;~\sep\ and rescue me because of Your grace.~\sep

  For in death there is no remembrance of You;~\sep\ in Sheol who gives You thanks?~\sep

  I am weary by my groanings and all night long I drench my bed;~\sep\ I make my bed wet with my tears.~\sep

  My eye is pained (\translationoption{grieved}) from anger;~\sep\ I am agitated because of all my enemies.~\sep

  Depart from me, all practitioners of falsehood,~\sep\ for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.~\sep

  The Lord has heard my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer.~\sep

  May all my enemies be very ashamed and broken;~\sep\ may they turn back and suddenly be destroyed.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{7}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Lord my God, in You I have put my trust; save me!~\sep\ and deliver me from all those who pursue me,~\sep

  \qanona{Blessed be God, who corrects and consoles His servants.}

  lest they tear my soul apart like a lion~\sep\ and there is no one who saves and delivers.~\sep

  O Lord my God, if I have done this~\sep\ and if there is iniquity on my hands,~\sep

  and if I have requited the one who has done evil to me,~\sep\ and if I have oppressed my enemy without cause,~\sep

  may my enemy pursue my soul and overtake it;~\sep\ and may he trample my life in the ground;~\sep\ and may he make my glory dwell in the dust.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord, in Your anger;~\sep\ and be exalted over the neck of my enemies,~\sep\ and watch (\translationoption{be aroused}) over me in the judgment that You have commanded.~\sep

  May the assembly of the nations gather around You;~\sep\ on behalf of them may You return on high.~\sep

  May the Lord judge the peoples;~\sep\ judge me, Lord, according to my righteousness and my integrity.~\sep

  May evil be accomplished upon the wicked;~\sep\ but may You establish the righteous,~\sep\ You who examines the heart and the reins.~\sep

  The righteous God upholds (\translationoption{helps}) me,~\sep\ God, who saves the upright of heart.~\sep

  God is a fair Judge (\translationoption{Judge of truth}),~\sep\ and He is not angry every day.~\sep

  If He does not turn back (\translationoption{changes}), He sharpens his sword, and He stretches out His bow.~\sep

  He has prepared and is preparing for Himself instruments (\translationoption{vessels}) of anger;~\sep\ He made His arrows fiery ones (\translationoption{He has made ready His arrows against those that burn [with envy]})\footnote{Translation recommended by S. Brock; Taylor: ``He has made ready his flaming arrows''; Psalterium Pianum: ``He will make His arrows fiery''.}.~\sep

  For the wicked is in travail, and he has conceived falsehood and given birth to deceit.~\sep

  He made a well and dug it out;~\sep\ and he fell into the pit that he made.~\sep

  His iniquity will return on his own head;~\sep\ his iniquity will come down on the crown of his head.~\sep

  I will praise the Lord according to my righteousness;~\sep\ and I will sing to the Name of the Lord most High.
\end{normalparskip}

\slota{Slota: We are bound to confess, worship and glorify You, Lord our Lord, hidden in Your Being, who from the mouth of boys and children have established Your glory, at all seasons and times, Lord of all...}

\marmita{3}

\psalm{8}

\begin{normalparskip}
  O Lord, our Lord,~\sep\ how glorious is Your Name in all the earth!~\sep\ For you have set Your glory above the heavens.~\sep

  \qanona{Son, whom the children praised in Jerusalem with their Hosanna's, we ask You, save those who worship You.}

  From the mouth of the young and of children~\sep\ You have established Your glory~\sep

  because of Your enemies,~\sep\ so that the enemy who takes vengeance might be brought to naught.~\sep

  For they have seen Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,~\sep\ the moon and the stars that You have established.~\sep

  What is man that You have remembered him?~\sep\ Or the son of man, that You have visited (\translationoption{took care for}) him?~\sep

  You made him a little less than the angels;~\sep\ You clothed him with honour and glory.~\sep

  You gave him authority over the work of Your hands;~\sep\ and You placed everything under his feet:~\sep

  all sheep and cattle,~\sep\ even the animals of the field, and the birds that are in the sky,~\sep

  and the fish of the sea that travel along in the paths of the seas.~\sep

  O Lord, our Lord, how glorious is Your Name in all the earth!
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{9}

\begin{normalparskip}
  I will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart;~\sep\ I will recount all Your wonders.~\sep

  \qanona{We give You thanks, for in Your mercy You have turned us to Your knowledge; let our adversaries be put to confusion.}

  I will be glad and exult in You;~\sep\ and I will sing to Your Name, O Most High.~\sep

  When my enemies turn backwards,~\sep\ they stumble and perish before You.~\sep

  For You have brought about my retribution (\translationoption{reward}) and my verdict (\translationoption{judgment});~\sep\ You are seated upon the throne as the righteous Judge.~\sep

  You have rebuked the peoples and You have destroyed the wicked.~\sep\ You have blotted out their names forever and ever.~\sep

  My enemies are consumed by the sword forever;~\sep\ You have uprooted cities and destroyed their memory.~\sep

  The Lord abides forever;~\sep\ and He establishes His throne for judgment,~\sep

  so that He might judge the world in truth;~\sep\ and the peoples in righteousness.~\sep

  The Lord is a refuge for the poor~\sep\ and their helper in times of distress.~\sep

  All those who know Your Name will put trust in You,~\sep\ for You, O Lord, do not abandon those who seek You.~\sep

  Sing to the Lord, who dwells in Zion;~\sep\ and declare His deeds among the peoples.~\sep

  For He remembers to avenge their blood;~\sep\ and He does not forget the cry of the poor.~\sep

  Have mercy on me, O Lord;~\sep\ see my subjection at the hands of those who hate me,~\sep\ You who raise me up from the gates of death,~\sep

  so that I may declare all Your wonders~\sep\ in the gates of daughter Zion,~\sep\ I will exult in Your salvation.~\sep

  The peoples have sunk into the pit that they made;~\sep\ their feet have been caught in the snare (\translationoption{net}) that they concealed.~\sep

  The Lord makes known the judgment that He executes;~\sep\ the wicked is caught by the work of his own hands.~\sep

  The wicked will return to Sheol,~\sep\ and all the peoples who forget God.~\sep

  For the poor are not forgotten forever;~\sep\ and You will not do away with the hope of the poor forever.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord, and let no(t) man prevail;~\sep\ let the peoples be judged in Your sight.~\sep

  Appoint for them a lawgiver,~\sep\ so that the peoples may know that they are only men.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{10}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Why, O Lord, do You stand far away~\sep\ and turn away your eyes (\translationoption{attention}) in times of distress?~\sep

  \qanona{Since the wicked laid ambushes for (\translationoption{acted treacherously towards}) the just and desecrate Your Name, destroy, my Lord, their plotting!}

  Through the pride of the wicked the poor is consumed;~\sep\ may they be ensnared by the plan that they have devised.~\sep

  For the wicked boasts in the desires of his soul;~\sep\ the wicked is [called] blessed, but the Lord is angry.~\sep\ The wicked in his haughtiness does not make any inquiry;~\sep\ God is not in any of his thoughts.~\sep

  His ways are always profane;~\sep\ Your judgment is exalted above his awareness.~\sep\ and he treats all his enemies with contempt.~\sep

  He says in his heart, I will not be shaken throughout all generations.~\sep

  He meditates on evil and his mouth is full of cursing;~\sep\ fraud and deceit are under his tongue, iniquity and depravity.~\sep

  He sits in ambush at the dwelling,~\sep\ and in secret he slays the righteous,~\sep\ his eyes gaze on the poor.~\sep

  He lies in ambush to do violence to (\translationoption{to snare}) the poor by the torment of his snare (\translationoption{in the drawing of his net}).~\sep

  He will be humbled and fall;~\sep\ and sickness and pain are in his bones.~\sep

  He says in his heart, ``God is unmindful (\translationoption{has forgotten});~\sep\ He has turned away His face and never sees''.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord my God, and lift up Your hand;~\sep\ do not be unmindful of (\translationoption{forget not}) the poor.~\sep

  Why does the sinner provoke God to anger~\sep\ and say in his heart, ``He does not avenge''?~\sep

  You see that there is injustice and wrath;~\sep\ and You consider that he will be given up into Your hands.~\sep\ The poor will be abandoned (\translationoption{commit himself}) to You;~\sep\ and You are the Helper of the orphan.~\sep

  Break the arm of the sinner and of the wicked;~\sep\ may his sin seek him, and may he not be found.~\sep

  The Lord is King forever and ever;~\sep\ the heathen have perished from His land.~\sep

  You, O Lord, hear the hope of the poor;~\sep\ and Your ear inclines to the preparation of their heart,~\sep

  to administer justice for the orphans and the needy,~\sep\ so that he (\translationoption{He?}) not again destroy men from the earth.

\begin{normalparskip}
  In the Lord I trust. How can you say to my soul,~\sep\ ‘Flee and dwell upon the mountains like a bird.~\sep

  \qanona{The sinners have deceived me; I have trusted in You, Lord!}

  For look! Sinners have drawn the bow;~\sep\ and they have prepared their arrows on the bow-string~\sep\ to shoot in the darkness at the upright of heart.~\sep

  For that which You made ready they have overthrown;~\sep\ but what is the righteous going to do?~\sep

  The Lord is in His holy temple;~\sep\ the Lord's throne is in the heavens.~\sep\ His eyes see; and His eyelids examine the sons of men.~\sep

  The Lord examines the righteous and the wicked;~\sep\ and He hates those who love iniquity.~\sep

  Snares have come down on the wicked like rain;~\sep\ fire and brimstone~\sep\ and an afflicting wind are the portion of their cup.~\sep

  For the Lord is righteous, and He loves righteousness,~\sep\ and His face beholds uprightness.

\psalm{12}

\begin{normalparskip}
  Save, O Lord, for the good became extinct (\translationoption{there is no good one left});~\sep\ and faith (\translationoption{truth}) has vanished from (\translationoption{ceased upon}) the earth.~\sep

  \qanona{Deceit has increased and love has decreased; do not turn away from us, Messiah!}

  Men speak vanity;~\sep\ and a man with his neighbour with divisive lips,~\sep\ heart to heart he speaks\footnote{Translation of Fr. Ephraim Ashur Alkhas, a scholarly Assyrian priest; A. Oliver: ``with a double heart''; R.A. Taylor: ``secretly, lit. In the heart and in the heart''.}.~\sep

  May the Lord destroy all divisive lips~\sep\ and tongues that speak haughtily (\translationoption{boastful things}).~\sep

  They say, ``We will magnify our tongue.~\sep\ and: Our lips belong to us; who is Lord over us''?~\sep

  Because of the spoil of the poor and the groan of the needy,~\sep\ ``I will therefore (\translationoption{now}) arise'', says the Lord.~\sep\ ``I will openly execute deliverance''.~\sep

  The word of the Lord is a pure word;~\sep\ it is choice silver that has been proven in the earth~\sep\ and refined seven times.~\sep

  You, O Lord, will keep them;~\sep\ deliver me and save me from this generation forever.~\sep

  For the wicked walk all around~\sep\ according to the base haughtiness of the sons of Edom.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{13}

\begin{normalparskip}
  How long will you forget me, O Lord? Forever?~\sep\ How long will You turn away Your face from me?~\sep

  \qanona{Be reconciled with me, Lord and save me, so that I may praise You.}

  How long will You put sorrow in my soul,~\sep\ and misery in my heart every day?~\sep\ How long will my enemy be exalted over me?~\sep

  Look and answer (\translationoption{hear}) me, O Lord my God;~\sep\ and illumine my eyes, lest I sleep in death.~\sep

  May my enemy not say, I have overcome him;~\sep\ nor may my oppressors rejoice over me when I am shaken.~\sep

  But I trust in Your grace;~\sep\ may my heart rejoice in Your salvation.~\sep

  I will praise the Lord who has saved me.
\end{normalparskip}

\psalm{14}

\begin{normalparskip}
  The wicked says in his heart, ``There is no God''.~\sep\ They are corrupt and defiled in their contrivances;~\sep

  \qanona{Rescue Your Church from the evil ones, Lord of all creatures!}

  there is no one who does good.~\sep

  The Lord looks out from the heavens on the sons of men,~\sep\ to see if there is anyone who understands and seeks God.~\sep

  All of them have gone astray (\translationoption{turned away}) altogether and are rejected;~\sep\ there is none who does good, not even one.~\sep

  All of the workers of iniquity lack understanding;~\sep\ they devour my people as though eating bread.~\sep\ They have not cried out to the Lord.~\sep

  They greatly feared there,~\sep\ for God is in the generation of the righteous.~\sep

  They have dishonoured the thinking of the poor,~\sep\ because the Lord is his confidence.~\sep

  Who will impart salvation to Israel from Zion?~\sep\ When the Lord restores the captivity of His people, may Jacob rejoice, and may Israel be glad!

  Lord, who may dwell in Your sanctuary?~\sep\ Who may reside on Your holy mountain?~\sep

  The one who walks blamelessly and who practices (\translationoption{does}) righteousness,~\sep\ who speaks the truth in his heart, and who is without deceit in his tongue,~\sep

  who does not inflict harm on his friend,~\sep\ who does not accept a bribe against his neighbour,~\sep

  In whose eyes provokers are despised.~\sep\ Instead, he honours those who fear the Lord;~\sep\ he takes an oath with his friend and does not deceive;~\sep

  he does not lend (\translationliteral{gives}) his money with interest,~\sep\ and he does not accept a bribe against the innocent.~\sep\ Whoever does these things is just;~\sep\ he will never be shaken.

\begin{normalparskip}
  Preserve me, O God, for I trust in You.~\sep\ I said to the Lord, ``You are my Lord;~\sep

  my goodness (\translationoption{prosperity}) is from You''.~\sep

  also for the saints who are on earth (\translationoption{the land}) and the praiseworthy,~\sep\ in whom is all my delight.~\sep

  Their latter pains will increase quickly\footnote{Psalterium Pianum adds: those who follow strange gods.}~\sep\ I will not pour out their libations of blood.~\sep\ I will not mention their names with my lips.~\sep

  The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup;~\sep\ You restore to me my inheritance.~\sep

  The measuring lines\footnote{The cord of the land surveyor who divides the lands and measures out a lot of land for each.} have fallen to me in the best of places,~\sep\ also my inheritance is attractive to me.~\sep

  I will bless the Lord who counsels me;~\sep\ my reins also during the night instruct (\translationoption{chasten}) me.~\sep

  I have set the Lord before me at all times;~\sep\ He is at my right hand, so that I will not tremble.~\sep

  Therefore my heart rejoices and my glory exults;~\sep\ my flesh also will dwell securely.~\sep

  For You have not left my soul in Sheol;~\sep\ You have not allowed Your holy one to see corruption.~\sep

  You will show me Your path of life;~\sep\ I will be satisfied with the joy of Your face (\translationoption{presence})~\sep\ and with the gladness (\translationoption{pleasantness}) of the victory of Your right hand.

  You have searched my heart; and You have visited (\translationoption{inspected}) me at night.~\sep\ and You have examined me; and You did not find iniquity in me.~\sep\ The deeds of men have not crossed my mouth.~\sep

  By the word of Your lips,~\sep\ however, You have kept me from evil ways.~\sep

  You have sustained my walking in Your paths, so that my footsteps might not totter.~\sep

  I cry to You, for You answer me.~\sep\ O God, incline Your ear to me; listen to my words.~\sep

  Make Your holy one a wonder~\sep\ and a redeemer for those who trust (in You)~\sep\ from those who stand up against Your right hand.~\sep

  Keep me as the pupil of the eye;~\sep\ hide me in the shadow of Your wings~\sep

  from these sinners who plunder me~\sep\ and the enemies of my soul who oppose me.~\sep

  Shut (\translationoption{stop up}) the mouth of those who speak boastfulness.~\sep

  They praised me, but now they have surrounded me.~\sep\ They have set their eyes, so that they might hurl me on the ground.~\sep

  They are like a lion that seeks to tear,~\sep\ like a lion’s whelp that crouches in concealment.~\sep

  Arise, O Lord, before them, and make them bow;~\sep\ deliver my soul from the wicked and from the sword.~\sep

  From the dead who die at Your hands, O Lord,~\sep\ and from the dead of the grave~\sep\ may You divide them in life.~\sep\ Fill their bellies with Your treasures;~\sep\ may their children be filled, and may they leave the remainder to their children.~\sep

  For the pains of death surrounded me;~\sep\ and the feet of evildoers troubled me.~\sep

  The pains of Sheol surrounded me;~\sep\ the snares of death preceded me.~\sep

  In my distress I called to the Lord; and I called to God.~\sep\ He heard my voice from His temple;~\sep\ and my cry (\translationoption{bellowing}) before Him entered His ears.~\sep

  The earth shook and trembled;~\sep\ the foundations of the mountains trembled and burst asunder,~\sep\ because He was furious over them.~\sep

  Smoke went up in His anger,~\sep\ and fire from His countenance was inflamed,~\sep\ and coals blazed from it.~\sep

  He lowered the heavens and came down;~\sep\ and thick darkness was under His feet.~\sep

  He rode on the cherubim and flew;~\sep\ and He flew on the wings of the wind.~\sep

  He put the darkness as His shelter; and His tabernacle surrounded Him,~\sep\ the darkness of water in the clouds of the air.~\sep

  From the brightness of His tabernacle~\sep\ He made His clouds hailstones and burning coals of fire.~\sep

  The Lord thundered in the heavens;~\sep\ the Most High sounded forth (\translationliteral{gave}) His voice,~\sep\ hailstones and coals of fire.~\sep

  He sent forth His arrows and scattered them;~\sep\ He increased His lightnings and agitated them.~\sep

  The springs of water were visible (\translationoption{seen});~\sep\ and the foundations of the earth were uncovered~\sep\ by Your rebuke, O Lord,~\sep\ and by the breath of the wind of Your anger.~\sep

  He sent from on high and drew me out;~\sep\ and He received me from many waters.~\sep

  He delivered me from my powerful enemies,~\sep\ from my adversaries who were stronger than I.~\sep

  They went before me in the day of my adversities;~\sep\ but the Lord was my Saviour (\translationoption{a Saviour for me}).~\sep

  He brought me to an open space;~\sep\ He delivered me because He took pleasure in me.~\sep

  The Lord has requited me according to my righteousness;~\sep\ and according to the purity of my hands He has recompensed me.~\sep

  For all His judgments are before me;~\sep\ and I have not removed His laws from me.~\sep

  I was blameless with Him;~\sep\ and I guarded myself from my sins.~\sep

  The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness~\sep\ and according to the purity of my hands before His eyes.~\sep

  (B) With the holy You are holy;~\sep\ with the innocent You are innocent (\translationoption{perfect}).~\sep

  With the pure you are pure (\translationoption{elect});~\sep\ but with the perverse You show Yourself crafty.~\sep

  You will illumine my lamp;~\sep\ the Lord my God will illumine my darkness.~\sep

  As for God, His way is without blemish;~\sep\ the word of the Lord is proven;~\sep\ He is a helper to all those who trust in Him.~\sep

  For there is no God except the Lord;~\sep\ there is no one who is strong like our God.~\sep

  God is the One who has girded me with strength;~\sep\ He has made (\translationliteral{gave}) my way blameless.~\sep

  He has made my feet like those of a deer; and He has established me on the height.~\sep

  He has trained (\translationoption{taught}) my hands for the battle;~\sep\ He has strengthened my arms like a bow of brass.~\sep

  You have given me the shield of salvation;~\sep\ Your right hand will uphold me, and Your instruction (\translationoption{correction}) will educate me.~\sep

  You have made my steps wide beneath me, so that my ankles might not totter.~\sep

  I will pursue my enemies and overtake them;~\sep\ I will not turn aside until I destroyed (\translationoption{put an end to}) them.~\sep

  I will strike them, and they will not be able to rise;~\sep\ they will fall beneath my feet.~\sep

  You will gird me with strength for the battle;~\sep\ and You will bring those who oppose (\translationliteral{those standing against me}) me to their knees beneath me.~\sep

  You will shatter (\translationoption{break}) my enemies before me;~\sep\ and I will silence my enemies.~\sep

  They will call out, but there will be no saviour for them;~\sep\ they will beseech the Lord, but He will not answer them.~\sep

  I will pulverize them like dust carried along by the wind (\translationliteral{upon the face of the wind});~\sep\ I will trample them like the mud in (\translationliteral{of}) the markets (\translationoption{streets}).~\sep

  You will deliver me from the judgments of the people;~\sep\ You will make me the head of peoples.~\sep\ A people that I have not known will serve me.~\sep

  Obediently (\translationliteral{Hearing of the ear}) they will listen to me; (sons of) foreigners will subject to me.~\sep

  The (son of the) foreigners will be restrained;~\sep\ they will fall lame from their paths.~\sep

  The Lord lives, and blessed be the One who strengthens me!~\sep\ Exalted is my God and my Saviour!~\sep

  It is God who has granted me vengeance;~\sep\ and He has subdued the peoples under me.~\sep

  He has delivered me from my enemies;~\sep\ He has exalted (\translationoption{set up}) me over those who stand against me.~\sep\ From wicked men You will deliver me.~\sep

  Therefore I will give You thanks among the peoples, my Lord;~\sep\ I will sing to Your Name. He magnifies the salvation of His king;~\sep\ He shows grace to His anointed,~\sep\ to David and to his descendants (\translationliteral{his seed}) forever.

  I confessed my sins to You; and I did not hide my transgressions from You.~\sep\ I said that I would confess my transgressions to the Lord;~\sep\ You forgive me all my sins.~\sep

  For this reason everyone who is chosen by You will pray to You in an acceptable time;~\sep\ but the rush of many waters~\sep\ will not come near to him.~\sep

  You have sheltered me; and You have protected me from my enemies.~\sep

  Surround me with glory and salvation, so that I might understand (\translationoption{recognize}) You.~\sep

  You have delivered (\translationoption{given}) us over like sheep for food;~\sep\ and You have scattered us among the peoples (\translationoption{pagans}).~\sep

  You have sold Your people without price;~\sep\ and you have not increased (\translationoption{made more}) by their exchange.~\sep

  You have made us a reproach to our neighbours,~\sep\ and a mocking and a laughing-stock to those who surround us.~\sep

  All day long my shame is before me;~\sep\ and the shame of my face has covered me.~\sep

  All these things have befallen us; but we have not forgotten You.~\sep\ We have not been unfaithful to Your covenant.~\sep

  We have not turned back;~\sep\ and we have not turned our ways from Your path.~\sep

  For You have humbled us with a secondary place;~\sep\ You have covered us with the shadows of death.~\sep

  But we have not forgotten the Name of our God;~\sep\ we have not extended our hands to foreign gods.~\sep

  God is the One searching this out,~\sep\ for He knows the thought (\translationoption{intentions}) of the heart.~\sep

  For Your sake we are killed all day;~\sep\ and we are considered as sheep for the slaughter.~\sep

  Awake! Do not sleep, O Lord!~\sep\ Call us to mind, and do not forget us.~\sep

  Do not turn away Your face from us;~\sep\ and do not forget our humiliation and our afflictions.~\sep

  For our soul has slept in the dust;~\sep\ and our belly has stuck to the ground.~\sep

  Arise, help us! And save us because of Your mercies!

  O God, why have You forgotten us forever?~\sep\ Why have You strengthened Your anger against the sheep of Your pasture?~\sep

  \qanona{Lord of all, who reveal everything, do not cast out those who adore You!}

  Remember Your congregation that You purchased long ago (\translationliteral{from before}).~\sep\ and You saved the rod of Your inheritance,~\sep\ this mount Zion in which You have dwelt.~\sep

  Lift up Your servants over those who exalt themselves in strength;~\sep\ (ponder)\footnote{Psalterium Pianum: ``Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the foe has devastated everything in the sanctuary''. In this translation the addition of ``ponder'' is superfluous.} everything that the enemy wickedly does to Your sanctuary.~\sep

  Your enemies have boasted in the midst of Your festival;~\sep\ they have made their ensigns as signs.~\sep

  You know, as the highly exalted One,~\sep\ (that) like a dense forest of trees~\sep\ with axes they have hewn down the gates,~\sep\ together (\translationoption{at the same time; at once}) with pickaxes and hatchets.~\sep

  They have cast down and burned Your sanctuary with fire;~\sep\ and they have profaned in the land the sanctuary of Your Name.~\sep

  They have said in their heart, ``Let us destroy them together;~\sep\ and let us destroy all the festivals of God from the land.~\sep

  They have not seen their signs;~\sep\ there is no longer a prophet, nor is there a wise person among us.~\sep

  How long, O God?~\sep\ Will the enemy reproach and provoke Your Name forever?~\sep

  Why have You turned back Your hand, and your right hand from the midst of Your festival?~\sep

  Our God is king;~\sep\ for You gave commandment long ago concerning the salvation of Jacob.~\sep

  By Your strength You divided the sea;~\sep\ and You broke the heads of the dragons in the waters.~\sep

  You broke in pieces the heads of Leviathan;~\sep\ and You gave him as food to a strong people.~\sep

  You burst through the springs in the river beds;~\sep\ You dried up mighty rivers.~\sep

  The days are Yours, and the nights are Yours;~\sep\ You prepared the light and the sun.~\sep

  You established all the boundaries of the earth;~\sep\ as for summer and winter, You created them.~\sep

  Remember, O Lord, the reproach of the enemy;~\sep\ foolish people have provoked Your Name.~\sep

  Do not give over to crushing the soul that acknowledges You;~\sep\ nor forget forever the souls of Your poor ones.~\sep

  Give heed, Lord, to Your covenant,~\sep\ for the dwellings of the earth are full of darkness and iniquity.~\sep

  Let a poor person not sit in shame;~\sep\ may the needy and the poor praise Your Name.~\sep

  Arise, O God, and make Your judgments;~\sep\ remember Your reproach that comes from the foolish all day.~\sep

  Do not forget the voice of Your enemies;~\sep\ nor the tumult of those who arise against You,~\sep\ that rises continually.

  My people, give ear (\translationoption{give heed}) to my law and be obedient;~\sep\ and incline Your ears to the words of my mouth.~\sep

  \qanona{The sons of Israel, a perverse people.}

  For look! I will open my mouth in parables;~\sep\ I will utter allegories of a long time ago.~\sep

  We know those things that we have heard,~\sep\ and also those things that our ancestors (\translationoption{fathers}) related to us,~\sep

  so that we might not hide (them) from their children,~\sep\ but relate to another generation~\sep

  the praises of the Lord and His power~\sep\ and His wondrous deeds that He has accomplished.~\sep

  He has established His testimony in Jacob;~\sep\ and He has laid His law in Israel,~\sep

  as He commanded our ancestors~\sep\ that they should make (it) known to their children,~\sep

  so that another generation might know (it):~\sep\ the children who are being born and are remaining (\translationoption{arise}),~\sep\ so that they might relate (it) to their children,~\sep

  so that their hope might be in God~\sep\ and that they not forget the works of God,~\sep\ but keep His commandments.~\sep

  And that they not be like their ancestors (\translationoption{fathers}),~\sep\ an evil and contentious (\translationoption{provoking}) generation,~\sep\ a generation that did not set its heart in order~\sep\ and did not believe the God of their spirit.~\sep

  The sons of Ephraim who stretched the bowstring and shot with the bow,~\sep\ but turned back in the day of battle,~\sep

  because they did not keep the covenant of God~\sep\ and did not wish to walk in His law.~\sep

  They forgot His works and His wondrous deeds~\sep\ that He showed them in the presence of their fathers (\translationoption{ancestors}).~\sep

  For He did wondrous deeds in the land of Egypt~\sep\ and in the fields of Zoan.~\sep

  He made a breach in the sea and made them cross over;~\sep\ and He caused the waters to stand as in bottles.~\sep

  He led them during the day by a cloud,~\sep\ and all night by a light of fire.~\sep

  He cleft the rock in the wilderness;~\sep\ and He gave them drink as from the great deep.~\sep

  He brought forth streams (\translationoption{running water}) from the rock;~\sep\ the waters flowed like rivers.~\sep

  But the people continued to sin (\translationoption{sinned still more});~\sep\ and to provoke the Most High in the thirsty region.~\sep

  They tested God in their heart~\sep\ by asking for food for their souls.~\sep

  They murmured against God and said,~\sep\ ``Is God able to spread tables for us in the wilderness?~\sep

  If He struck the rock and waters flowed and torrents shed forth,~\sep\ is He able to give us bread also? Or can He provide food for His people?''~\sep

  Because of this the Lord heard and became angry;~\sep\ and a fire was kindled against Jacob;~\sep\ anger also rose against Israel.~\sep

  Because they did not believe in God;~\sep\ they did not hope for His salvation.~\sep

  (B) He commanded the clouds from above;~\sep\ and the doors of the heavens were opened.~\sep

  He made manna come down for them to eat;~\sep\ and He gave the bread of heaven to them.~\sep

  Men ate the bread of angels;~\sep\ and He sent them food to satisfy them.~\sep

  He made winds blow in the heavens;~\sep\ and by His strength He guided the south wind.~\sep

  He brought down to them flesh like dust~\sep\ and feathered birds like the sand of the seas.~\sep

  They fell in their encampments, all around their tents.~\sep

  They ate and were very satisfied; and He gave them what they craved.~\sep

  But they did not withdraw from their cravings;~\sep\ and while their food was (still) in their mouths,~\sep

  the anger of God rose against them.~\sep\ and He slew some of their wealthy;~\sep\ He made the chosen ones of Israel to kneel down.~\sep

  In all these things they sinned;~\sep\ and again they did not believe in His wondrous works.~\sep

  They ended their days in vanity,~\sep\ and their years in haste.~\sep

  When He slew them, they would seek Him;~\sep\ and they would turn back and come to Him.~\sep

  They remembered that God was their Helper~\sep\ and the Most High God was their Saviour.~\sep

  They loved Him with their mouth, but with their tongue they lied to Him.~\sep

  They did not make their heart right with Him; and they did not believe in His covenant.~\sep

  Yet He was merciful, forgiving sins and not destroying.~\sep\ Time and again He turned away His anger and did not arouse all His wrath.~\sep

  He remembered that they were flesh;~\sep\ a wind that passes (\translationoption{goes}) and does not return.~\sep

  They provoked Him in the wilderness;~\sep\ and they angered Him in the desert.~\sep

  They turned away and tested God;~\sep\ and provoked the Holy One of Israel.~\sep

  They did not remember His hand, the day that He saved them from the oppressor,~\sep

  that He performed His signs in Egypt~\sep\ and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.~\sep

  For He turned their rivers into blood,~\sep\ and their streams, so that they could not drink the water.~\sep

  He sent upon them a swarm (of insects) that consumed them,~\sep\ and frogs that devastated them.~\sep

  He gave their harvests to the locusts,~\sep\ and their labour to the crawling (\translationoption{young}) locust.~\sep

  He ruined their vines with hail~\sep\ and their fig trees with ice.~\sep

  He gave their cattle over to the hail~\sep\ and their possessions to the fire (\translationoption{conflagration}).~\sep

  He sent upon them His fierce anger (\translationoption{the fierceness of His anger}).~\sep\ Wrath and anger and distress~\sep\ He sent by the hand of an evil angel.~\sep

  He forced open evil paths;~\sep\ and He did not spare their souls from death.~\sep\ He delivered their animals over to death.~\sep

  He slew all the firstborn of Egypt;~\sep\ the chief of all their progeny in the tabernacle of Ham.~\sep

  (C) He led forth His people like sheep;~\sep\ He led them like a flock in the wilderness.~\sep

  He made them dwell in hope, and they did not fear;~\sep\ but the sea covered (\translationoption{overwhelmed}) their enemies.~\sep

  He brought them to the border of His sanctuary;~\sep\ to this mountain that His right hand acquired.~\sep

  He destroyed the peoples from before them;~\sep\ He placed them by the lot (\translationliteral{measuring lines}) of His inheritance.~\sep\ The tribes of Israel dwelt in their tents.~\sep

  They tested and provoked the Most High God;~\sep\ and did not keep His testimonies.~\sep

  They turned away and acted deceitfully like their fathers (\translationoption{ancestors});~\sep\ they were turned away like a deceitful (\translationoption{crooked}) bow.~\sep

  They angered Him with their high places; and provoked Him to jealousy with their idols.~\sep

  God heard and became furious;~\sep\ He was very angry with Israel.~\sep

  He forgot (\translationoption{abandoned}) the tabernacle of Shiloh,~\sep\ the tabernacle where He dwelt among men.~\sep

  He delivered (\translationoption{gave}) His people to captivity; and His glory into the hand of the oppressor.~\sep

  He delivered His people to the sword; and disregarded (\translationoption{turned away from}) His inheritance.~\sep

  Fire consumed their young men;~\sep\ and their young women were ill-treated.~\sep

  Their priests fell by the sword;~\sep\ and their widows were not lamented.~\sep

  The Lord awoke as from sleep,~\sep\ and like a mighty man who has become sober (\translationliteral{shaken off his wine}).~\sep

  He struck His enemies in the back (\translationoption{behind Him});~\sep\ He made (\translationliteral{give}) them the reproach of the world.~\sep

  He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph;~\sep\ and was not pleased with the tribe of Ephraim.~\sep

  He chose the tribe of Judah;~\sep\ mount Zion, which He loved.~\sep

  He built His sanctuary on a high place;~\sep\ and established it on the earth forever.~\sep

  He chose David His servant;~\sep\ and led him away from the sheepfold~\sep

  and from behind the nursing sheep,~\sep\ so that He might shepherd (\translationoption{fed}) Jacob His people and Israel His inheritance.~\sep

  So He shepherded (\translationoption{fed}) them in the integrity of His heart;~\sep\ by the skill (\translationoption{understanding}) of His hands He led them.

  You rule over the magnificence of the sea;~\sep\ and You silence the tossing of its waves.~\sep

  You humble the boastful like those who are killed;~\sep\ by Your strong arm You have scattered Your enemies.~\sep

  The heavens belong to You, and the earth belongs to You;~\sep\ You have established the world in its fullness.~\sep

  You have created the north and the south;~\sep\ Tabor and Hermon praise Your Name.~\sep

  You have rejected (\translationoption{despised}) the covenant of Your servant;~\sep\ and cast his crown down on the ground.~\sep

  You have hewn down his hedges; and You have overturned his citadels.~\sep

  You have exalted the right hand of his enemies,~\sep\ and caused all his adversaries (\translationoption{those who hate me}) to rejoice.~\sep

  You have turned back the help of his sword;~\sep\ and have not assisted him in battle.~\sep

  You have brought his victors to an end;~\sep\ and thrown his crown to the ground.~\sep

  You have shortened the days of his youth;~\sep\ and clothed him with shame.~\sep

  How long will You be angry, O Lord? Forever?~\sep\ and Your anger burn like fire?~\sep

  Remember me from the pit,~\sep\ for You have not created all men in vain.~\sep

  Who is the man who will live and not see death?~\sep\ Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?~\sep

  I will sing of grace and justice (\translationoption{judgment});~\sep\ and I will praise You, O Lord.~\sep

  \qanona{The Lord in whom I trusted, by His mercies rescues me from the enemies who hated me.}

  \emph{[Christmas: Let us praise and glorify the Splendour of justice, which has radiated from the house of David.]}

  I will walk in Your path without blemish;~\sep\ how long till You come to me?~\sep\ I have walked in the integrity of my heart in my house.~\sep

  I have set no wicked thing before my eyes.~\sep\ I have hated the one who does evil; he has not accompanied (\translationoption{cleaved to}) me.~\sep

  An evil heart has passed me by; I have not known an evil thing.~\sep

  I would destroy the one who accuses (\translationoption{slanders}) his neighbour in secret.~\sep\ With the one whose eyes are proud and whose heart is swollen with pride, I would not eat.~\sep

  My eyes are on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me.~\sep\ As for the one who walks in the path without blemish, he will serve me.~\sep

  The one who practices deceit will not dwell within my house;~\sep\ and false utterance will not be established before my eyes.~\sep

  In the morning I will silence all the wicked of the land;~\sep\ and I will destroy from the city of the Lord~\sep\ all the workers of iniquity.

  \emph{Memorials (feasts):} Come, my beloved, let us sing glory in the day of the memorial of famous N. (or feast N.) and sing and cry with the alleluia of the watchful ones, who have come down in companies and celebrated it with processions.

  O Lord, hear my prayer;~\sep\ and let my cry enter to You.~\sep

  \qanona{Have compassion on our aberration, unchangeable Being.}

  \emph{[or: Compassionate One, hear our request and our prayers.]}

  Do not turn away Your face from me in the day of my distress,~\sep\ but incline Your ear to me in the day that I call out to You and answer me quickly.~\sep

  For my days are consumed in smoke;~\sep\ and my bones have become white like hearths.~\sep

  My heart has withered like grass and dried up,~\sep\ for I have forgotten to eat my food (\translationoption{bread}).~\sep\ From the sound of my groans my flesh sticks to my bones.~\sep

  I am like a pelican that is in the wilderness;~\sep\ and I am like an owl in ruins (\translationoption{desert places}).~\sep

  I remain alone and am by myself~\sep\ like a sparrow (\translationoption{small bird}) that flies over housetops.~\sep

  All day long my enemies have reviled me;~\sep\ and those who praise me have taken an oath against me.~\sep

  For I have eaten ashes like bread~\sep\ and I have mixed my drink with tears~\sep

  because of Your rage and Your anger, for You have lifted me up and thrown me down.~\sep

  My days have declined like a shadow;~\sep\ and I have dried up like grass.~\sep

  But You, O Lord, remain forever;~\sep\ and Your remembrance is for generations.~\sep

  Arise, and have mercy on Zion,~\sep\ for the time has arrived to show mercy on her.~\sep

  For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and they love her dust.~\sep

  Peoples (\translationoption{Pagans}) will fear Your Name, O Lord;~\sep\ and all the kings of the earth (will fear) Your glory.~\sep

  For the Lord will rebuild Zion;~\sep\ and He appears in His glory.~\sep

  He turns to the prayer of the poor;~\sep\ and He does not despise their prayer.~\sep

  This will be written for another (\translationoption{next}) generation;~\sep\ a people that is yet to be created will praise the Lord.~\sep

  For He gazed from the height of His sanctuary;~\sep\ the Lord gazed on the earth from the heavens~\sep

  to hear the groan of the prisoner~\sep\ and to release children from death,~\sep

  so that they might relate the Name of the Lord in Zion~\sep\ and His praises in Jerusalem,~\sep

  when the peoples are assembled together~\sep\ and the kingdoms to serve the Lord.~\sep

  They laid low my strength in the earth;~\sep\ but speak to me the fewness (\translationoption{paucity}) of my days.~\sep

  Do not take me up in the midst (\translationliteral{half}) of my days;~\sep\ and Your years are for generations.~\sep

  Of old You established the earth;~\sep\ and the heavens are the work of Your hands.~\sep

  They pass away, but You remain;~\sep\ and they all wear out like a garment;~\sep\ and like a mantle they are changed.~\sep

  But You are as You are; and Your years do not fail.~\sep

  The sons of Your servants will dwell in the earth;~\sep\ their seed will be established before You.

  Bless the Lord, my soul;~\sep\ and all my bones His holy Name.~\sep

  Bless the Lord, my soul;~\sep\ do not forget all His rewards.~\sep

  He forgives You all your iniquity; and He heals all your diseases.~\sep

  He saves you from destruction;~\sep\ He sustains you with grace and mercies.~\sep

  He satisfies your body with good things;~\sep\ and He renews your youth like that of the eagle.~\sep

  The Lord executes (\translationoption{performs}) righteousness~\sep\ and justice (\translationoption{judgment}) for all the oppressed.~\sep

  He declared His ways to Moses;~\sep\ His deeds to the children of Israel.~\sep

  The Lord is merciful and compassionate,~\sep\ long-suffering and abounding in His graciousness.~\sep

  For He does not stay angry forever;~\sep\ and He does not retain His anger forever.~\sep

  For He has not dealt with us according to our sins~\sep\ nor has He rewarded us according to our iniquity~\sep

  for as the heavens are higher than the earth,~\sep\ so great is the grace of the Lord on those who fear Him~\sep

  As the east is far from the west,~\sep\ so (far) has He removed our iniquity from us.~\sep

  As a father has compassion on the children,~\sep\ the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.~\sep

  For He knows our formation;~\sep\ and He remembers that we are dust.~\sep

  As for man, his days are like grass;~\sep\ and like a flower of the field, so he springs up.~\sep

  But when the wind blows on it, it is no more;~\sep\ neither is its place known.~\sep

  The grace of the Lord is from everlasting~\sep\ and to everlasting on those who fear Him.~\sep

  His righteousness is to their children's children~\sep\ for those who keep His covenant~\sep\ and remember His commandments and execute them.~\sep

  As for the Lord, His throne is established in the heavens;~\sep\ and His kingdom has authority over all.~\sep

  Bless the Lord, His angels,~\sep\ who are all-powerful and carry out His commandments.~\sep

  Bless the Lord, all His hosts,~\sep\ His ministers who do His will.~\sep

  Bless the Lord, all His works,~\sep\ Whose rule is in all the earth.~\sep\ Bless the Lord, my soul.

\begin{normalparskip}
  Bless the Lord, my soul.~\sep\ O Lord my God, You are very great;~\sep

  Qanona: Adorable is the Creator, forever and ever.

  [or: Glory becomes Your great Name at all times.]

  You are clothed with brightness and honour.~\sep\ and You are covered with light, as with a mantle;~\sep\ You have stretched out the heavens like a curtain.~\sep

  He has made His habitations on the waters;~\sep\ and placed His chariot on the clouds.~\sep\ and He walks on the wings of the wind.~\sep

  He has made His angels spirit~\sep\ and His ministers a burning fire.~\sep

  He has established the earth on its foundations,~\sep\ so that it can never totter.~\sep

  You covered it with the deep, as with a mantle;~\sep\ and the waters stood above the mountains.~\sep

  At Your rebuke they flee;~\sep\ and at the sound of Your thunders they are terrified.~\sep

  They ascended to the mountains and descended to the valleys (\translationoption{plains}),~\sep\ to the place that You established for them.~\sep

  You have set a boundary for them,~\sep\ so that they may not cross over and cover the earth.~\sep

  You sent springs in the valleys;~\sep\ they travel among the mountains.~\sep

  They give to drink to every animal of the field;~\sep\ and wild donkeys that thirst are satisfied.~\sep

  Birds of the heavens settle on them;~\sep\ and they utter (\translationliteral{give}) a sound among the mountains.~\sep

  He irrigates the mountains from His habitations,~\sep\ the earth is satisfied by the fruits of Your works.~\sep

  He makes grass grow for the cattle~\sep\ and green herb for the cultivation of the sons of men.~\sep

  so that they may bring forth bread (\translationoption{food}) from the earth:~\sep

  wine that gladdens the heart of man,~\sep\ oil to make him a cheerful countenance,~\sep\ bread (\translationoption{food}) that sustains the heart of man.~\sep

  The trees of the Lord are satiated (\translationoption{full}),~\sep\ and the cedars of Lebanon that You planted.~\sep

  Birds make their nests there;~\sep\ and the stork (\translationoption{heron}), its nest is in the cypress trees.~\sep

  The high mountains are for the ibex;~\sep\ and the rocky crags are a hiding place for the conies.~\sep

  (B) He made the moon for times;~\sep\ and the sun knows the time of its setting.~\sep

  \emph{We worship You, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.~\sep}

  He made darkness, and it was night;~\sep\ and during it all the animals of the forest pass by.~\sep

  Lions roar to tear apart~\sep\ and to seek their food from God.~\sep

  With the rising of the sun they gather together;~\sep\ in their dens (\translationoption{dwellings}) they lie down.~\sep

  Man goes out to his work,~\sep\ and to his labour (\translationoption{occupation}) until the evening.~\sep

  How many are Your works, O Lord!~\sep\ You created all of them in Your wisdom;~\sep\ the earth is full of Your possessions.~\sep

  This large and wide (\translationliteral{wide of hands}) sea,~\sep\ in which there are creeping things without number~\sep\ animals both large and small.~\sep

  Ships travel in it,~\sep\ and this Leviathan that You created to frolic (\translationoption{dance}) upon it.~\sep

  All of them wait for You,~\sep\ so that You may give them food in their time.~\sep

  You give to them and they are nourished;~\sep\ You open Your hand, and they are satisfied.~\sep

  You turn away Your face, and they are troubled.~\sep\ You take away their breath, and they die;~\sep\ and they return to their dust.~\sep

  You send forth Your spirit, and they are created;~\sep\ and You renew the face of the earth.~\sep

  The glory of the Lord will be forever;~\sep\ the Lord will rejoice in His works~\sep

  He who looks on the earth, and it trembles;~\sep\ He rebukes the mountains and they smoke.~\sep

  I will praise the Lord throughout my life;~\sep\ I will sing to my God as long as I remain.~\sep

  May my praise be pleasant to Him;~\sep\ and I will be glad in the Lord.~\sep

  But sinners will disappear from the earth;~\sep\ and the wicked will not remain in it.~\sep\ Bless the Lord, my soul.

  \qanona{Let us confess the Lord for His benefits to us and ask of Him that He supply that which we lack, for His love overflows forever.}

  \emph{[or: Yes, confess the hidden Being who is without beginning.]}

  Praise Him, and sing to Him;~\sep\ and relate all His wondrous deeds.~\sep

  Praise His holy Name;~\sep\ may the heart of those who seek the Lord be glad.~\sep

  Seek the Lord and be strong;~\sep\ and seek His face always.~\sep

  Remember His wondrous works that He has done,~\sep\ His wonders and the judgment of His mouth,~\sep

  You, the seed (\translationoption{descendants}) of Abraham His servant,~\sep\ and the sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.~\sep

  He is the Lord our God;~\sep\ His judgments are throughout all the earth.~\sep

  He remembers His covenant forever,~\sep\ the word that He commanded to a thousand generations.~\sep

  For He established his covenant with Abraham~\sep\ and His oaths with Isaac~\sep

  and His testimony with Jacob~\sep\ as a covenant with Israel forever.~\sep

  He said, ``To you I will give the land of Canaan~\sep\ as the portion (\translationoption{measuring lines}) of Your inheritance,~\sep

  When you were small in number~\sep\ and few and are dwellers in it.~\sep

  They travelled from people to people,~\sep\ and from (one) kingdom to another people.~\sep

  He permitted no man to oppress them;~\sep\ He rebuked kings for their sake:~\sep

  Do not touch (\translationoption{approach}) my anointed ones;~\sep\ and do not harm my prophets.~\sep

  He called for a famine on the land;~\sep\ and broke (\translationoption{destroyed}) all the stalks of their crop.~\sep

  He sent a man before them~\sep\ Joseph, sold into slavery.~\sep

  They bound his feet with fetters;~\sep\ and he (\translationliteral{his soul}) was put (\translationliteral{entered}) in irons,~\sep

  until his word (\translationliteral{what he said}) was proven correct.~\sep\ The word of the Lord proved (\translationoption{approved}) him.~\sep

  The king sent and released him,~\sep\ and made him ruler over his people,~\sep

  lord over his household, and ruler over his possessions,~\sep

  so that he might instruct (\translationoption{chastise}) the ruler as he wished~\sep\ and teach the elders wisdom.~\sep

  (C) Israel entered Egypt;~\sep\ Jacob sojourned in the tent of Ham.~\sep

  \emph{For in Egypt He wrought wonders, and they did not believe in Him.~\sep}

  He caused His people to increase greatly; and He made them stronger (\translationoption{more numerous}) than their enemies.~\sep

  He turned their heart to hate His people~\sep\ and to act deceitfully against His servants.~\sep

  He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.~\sep

  By them He performed His signs and His wonders in the land of Ham.~\sep

  He sent darkness and made it dark; and they provoked His word.~\sep

  He turned their waters to blood; and killed their fish.~\sep

  He caused frogs to swarm in their land,~\sep\ even in the inner chambers of their kings.~\sep

  He spoke, and there came swarms of insects~\sep\ and vermin (\translationoption{parasite}) throughout all their borders.~\sep

  He made their rain into hail;~\sep\ and a fire broke out (\translationoption{was kindled}) in their land.~\sep

  He struck their vines and their fig trees;~\sep\ and broke the trees of their borders.~\sep

  He spoke, and locusts came,~\sep\ and crawling locusts without number, throughout all their land.~\sep

  They ate up all the green herbs, and fruits of their lands.~\sep

  He slaughtered all the firstborn of Egypt,~\sep\ the eldest of all their offspring.~\sep

  He brought them forth with silver and gold;~\sep\ there was no one among their tribe who was infirm.~\sep

  \emph{Away from Egypt He wrought wonders, and saved His people.~\sep}

  Egypt was glad when they went forth,~\sep\ for a dread of them had fallen over them.~\sep

  He spread a cloud over them, and it covered them;~\sep\ and a fire to illumine by night.~\sep

  They asked, and He brought food for them; and He satisfied them with heavenly bread.~\sep

  He opened the rock, and waters gushed forth;~\sep\ and waters flowed in a dry place.~\sep

  For He remembered His holy word (\translationoption{promise}) to Abraham, His servant.~\sep

  He brought forth His people with gladness,~\sep\ and His young men with a song.~\sep

  He gave them the lands of the nations;~\sep\ and they inherited the labour of the peoples,~\sep

  so that they might keep His commandments~\sep\ and observe His laws.
