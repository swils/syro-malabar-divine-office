\cc~My Lord, all creatures which You have created, which have been fashioned by Your beckon, who by Your will have come into being, come before You and kneel and worship, sing and praise, ask and entreat, pray and beseech, confess and glorify You, for You are the cause of (all) beings, and the breath and respiration of our lives, Lord of all, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit forever.

  \Psalm{100} Praise the Lord, all the earth. --- \qanona{Giver of light, Lord, we lift up glory to You.}~\sep

  Praise the Lord, all the earth.~\sep\ Serve the Lord with gladness;~\sep

  Enter before Him with a hymn.~\sep\ Know that He is the Lord our God.~\sep

  It is He who made us, and not we ourselves.~\sep\ We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.~\sep

  Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise;~\sep\ give Him thanks and bless His Name.~\sep

  For the Lord is good, and His grace is forever;~\sep\ and His faithfulness is (\translationoption{lasts}) for generations.~\sep

  Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. From eternity and forever, amen.

\dd~Let us pray, peace be with us.

\cc~To You, my Lord, we lift up glory and confession, and continually offer worship and thanksgiving to Your living and holy Name, for You are the Lord and Creator of all, Father, Son and Holy Spirit forever...

\begin{halfparskip}
  \Psalm{91} He who sits in the shelter (\translationoption{hiding-place}) of the Most High, --- \qanona{Glorious is Your confidence, Christ, our Saviour.}~\sep

  He who sits in the shelter (\translationoption{hiding-place}) of the Most High~\sep\ and is glorified in the shadow of God,~\sep

  said to the Lord, You are my confidence;~\sep\ God is my refuge in whom I trust.~\sep

  For He will deliver you from the snare of scandal~\sep\ and from vain talk.~\sep

  On His pinions (\translationoption{feathers}) He will deliver you; and under His wings you will be sheltered;~\sep\ (like) armour His truth will surround you.~\sep

  Do not fear the terror of the night,~\sep\ nor the arrow that flies in the daytime,~\sep

  nor the word that walks in the darkness,~\sep\ nor the wind that devastates in the midday.~\sep

  Thousands will fall at your side;~\sep\ tens of thousands at your right hand.~\sep\ But they will not draw near to you.~\sep

  But with your eyes you alone will see;~\sep\ you will look on the punishment of the wicked.~\sep

  For You, O Lord, are my confidence;~\sep\ You have placed Your dwelling in the height.~\sep

  Misfortune (\translationoption{evil}) will not draw near to you;~\sep\ nor will disaster draw near to your dwelling.~\sep

  For He will appoint His angels over you,~\sep\ so that they may guard you in all your paths.~\sep

  Upon their arms they will carry you,~\sep\ so that you do not stumble with your foot.~\sep

  You will tread on the asp and the cockatrice;~\sep\ you will trample the lion and the dragon.~\sep

  Because he has sought me, I will deliver him and strengthen him.~\sep\ Because he has known My Name, He will call on Me, and I will answer him.~\sep

  I will be with him in distress;~\sep\ I will strengthen him and honour him.~\sep

  I will satisfy him with length of days; and I will show him My salvation.~\sep

\end{halfparskip}

\dd~Let us pray, peace be with us.

\cc~Glorious, my Lord, is the great confidence in Your Godhead, and high and exalted is the wondrous refuge of Your Majesty, and all who hope in You, trust in You, call Your holy Name, and beseech You at all seasons and times, will not be ashamed, Lord of all...

\begin{halfparskip}
  \Psalm{104,1--16} Bless the Lord, my soul! --- \qanona{May the glory of the Lord be for ever.}~\sep

  Bless the Lord, my soul.~\sep\ O Lord my God, You are very great;~\sep\ You are clothed with brightness and honour.~\sep

  You are covered with light, as with a mantle;~\sep\ You have stretched out the heavens like a curtain.~\sep

  He has made His habitations on the waters;~\sep\ and has placed His chariot on the clouds,~\sep\ and He walks on the wings of the wind.~\sep

  He has made His angels spirit~\sep\ and His ministers a blazing fire.~\sep

  He has established the earth on its foundations,~\sep\ so that it can never totter.~\sep

  You covered it with the deep, as with a mantle;~\sep\ and the waters stood above the mountains.~\sep

  At Your rebuke they flee;~\sep\ and at the sound of Your thunders they are terrified.~\sep

  They ascended to the mountains and descended to the valleys (\translationoption{plains}),~\sep\ to the place that You established for them.~\sep

  You have set a boundary for them,~\sep\ so that they may not cross over and cover the earth.~\sep

  You sent springs in the valleys;~\sep\ they travel among the mountains.~\sep

  They give to drink to every animal of the field;~\sep\ and wild donkeys that thirst are satisfied.~\sep

  Birds of the heavens settle on them;~\sep\ and they utter (\translationliteral{give}) a sound among the mountains.~\sep

  He irrigates the mountains from His habitations;~\sep\ the earth is satisfied by the fruits of Your works.~\sep

  He makes grass grow for the cattle~\sep\ and green herb for the cultivation of the sons of men.~\sep

  so that they may bring forth bread (\translationoption{food}) from the earth:~\sep\ wine that gladdens the heart of man,~\sep

  oil to make him a cheerful countenance,~\sep\ bread (\translationoption{food}) that sustains the heart of man.~\sep

  The trees of the Lord are satisfied (\translationoption{well watered}).~\sep

  \Psalm{113} Praise, servants of the Lord. --- \qanona{Glory to Him who created the light.}~\sep

  Praise, servants of the Lord;~\sep\ praise the Name of the Lord.~\sep

  Blessed be the Name of the Lord~\sep\ from always and for ever.~\sep

  From the rising of the sun to its setting~\sep\ the Name of the Lord is great.~\sep

  The Lord is high above all the peoples,~\sep\ and His honour is above the heavens.~\sep

  Who is like the Lord our God,~\sep\ who dwells on high and looks on the depths~\sep\ in heaven and on earth?~\sep

  He raises the needy from the dunghill,~\sep\ so that He might seat him with the princes of the people.~\sep

  He causes the barren woman to dwell at home (\translationoption{to keep house})~\sep\ as a joyful mother of children.~\sep

  Your throne was established long ago;~\sep\ and You are from everlasting.~\sep

  The rivers are lifted up, O Lord,~\sep\ the rivers have lifted up their voice;~\sep\ the rivers are lifted up in purity.~\sep

  More glorious than the sound of many waters,~\sep\ the mighty storms of the sea,~\sep\ is the Lord in the heights.~\sep

  Your testimonies are very trustworthy;~\sep\ and holiness becomes Your house,~\sep\ O Lord, for length of days.~\sep

  May they exalt God with their throats,~\sep\ with a double-edged sword in their hands~\sep

  to exact (\translationoption{inflict}) vengeance from the peoples~\sep\ and reproof from the nations,~\sep

  to bind their kings with fetters~\sep\ and their nobles with chains of iron,~\sep

  in order to carry out against them the judgment that is written.~\sep\ Praise to all His righteous ones.~\sep
