\markedsection{Psalms}

\liturgicalhint{On Sundays 3 hulale are recited farced with alleluia (respectively hulale 5-7 ; or 9-11 + Ps 81 ; or 12-14 or 16-18 + Ps 129)\footnote{In this Lelya booklet we replace every hulala by a marmita, excluding the marmiyata used in ramsa. We follow the ancient system in which the last hulala (here marmita) is ended by the psalm accompanying the qalta: pss 81 \& 129.}, followed on Sundays 'before' by Ps. 81, on Sundays 'after' by Ps. 129, farced with alleluia after each clause.}

\markedsunday{1. Sundays ``before''}{Marmita 29 (Pss 75-77)}

\begin{halfparskip}
  \Psalm{75} We praise You, O God;~\sep\ we praise You and call on Your Name.~\sep

  \liturgicalhint{Alleluia, alleluia, (alleluia). -- First verse.}

  We have related all Your wonderful deeds.~\sep\ ``For I will receive time, and I will judge with uprightness''.~\sep

  The earth will be humbled, and all its inhabitants;~\sep\ You have established its inhabitants.~\sep

  You said to the foolish, ``Deal not foolishly'',~\sep\ and to the wicked, ``Do not lift up the horn;~\sep

  do not lift up on high Your horn~\sep\ or speak haughtily'' (\translationliteral{with a haughty neck}).~\sep

  For there is no going forth from the west~\sep\ or from the desert of the mountains.~\sep

  For God is the judge;~\sep\ He humbles one and He exalts another.~\sep

  For a cup is in the hand of the Lord;~\sep\ it is full of a mixture of wine-dregs.~\sep

  He lowered (\translationoption{inclined}) it from one to another;~\sep\ all the wicked of the earth will strain out its dregs and drink them.~\sep

  But I will live forever;~\sep\ and I will sing to the God of Jacob.~\sep

  I will hack into pieces all the horns of the wicked;~\sep\ but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
\end{halfparskip}

\begin{halfparskip}
  \Psalm{76} God is known in Judah;~\sep\ His Name is great in Israel.~\sep

  His tabernacle will be in Salem;~\sep\ His dwelling place in Zion.~\sep

  There He shattered the arms of bows,~\sep\ the shield and the sword in battle.~\sep

  You are more resplendent and glorious than Your strong (\translationoption{fortified}) mountain.~\sep

  All the foolish-hearted were troubled;~\sep\ the mighty men have slept their sleep.~\sep

  Their hands were incapable because of Your rebuke, O God of Jacob;~\sep

  The riders of horses fell into a deep sleep, and~\sep\ You are fearsome.~\sep

  Who can stand before You in this anger?~\sep\ You heard judgment from the heavens;~\sep

  the earth saw and feared,~\sep\ when God was arising in order to judge~\sep\ and to save all the poor of the earth.~\sep

  For the mind of man will acknowledge You;~\sep\ and the remainder of His wrath will turn away anger.~\sep

  Vow and repay to the Lord your God;~\sep\ may all those around Him bring gifts to the awesome One,~\sep

  who humbles the spirit of rulers (\translationoption{princes})~\sep\ and is feared by the kings of the earth.
\end{halfparskip}

\begin{halfparskip}
  \Psalm{77} I cried out to God with my voice, and He heard me;~\sep\ I lifted up my voice to Him, and He answered me.~\sep

  In the day of my distress I sought the Lord.~\sep\ His hand beat me during the night, and I could not be still;~\sep\ there was no one to comfort my soul.~\sep

  I remembered God, and I was disturbed;~\sep\ and I thought, and my spirit was weary (\translationoption{agitated}).~\sep

  Dizziness took hold of my eyes;~\sep\ I became mute and did not speak.~\sep

  I thought about the days of old;~\sep\ I remembered the years of long ago.~\sep

  I meditated during the night and reflected in my heart (\translationoption{mind})~\sep\ I searched my spirit and said,~\sep

  Has the Lord forgotten me forever?~\sep\ Will He no more be pleased with me?~\sep

  Or will He forever remove His grace?~\sep\ Will He fulfil His word throughout the generations?~\sep\ Or has God forgotten to be compassionate?~\sep

  Or is He withholding His mercies in His anger?~\sep

  I said, ``It is my infirmity''~\sep\ They are a repetition [of strokes] of the right hand of the Most High.~\sep

  For I have remembered Your wondrous deeds of long ago.~\sep

  I have meditated on all Your works;~\sep\ I have pondered on Your artifices (\translationoption{doings}).~\sep

  O God, Your way is holy;~\sep\ there is no one great like our God.~\sep

  You are the God who has accomplished wonders~\sep\ and You have displayed Your strength among the peoples.~\sep

  You have redeemed Your people by Your arm,~\sep\ the sons (\translationoption{descendants}) of Jacob and Joseph.~\sep

  The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and feared.~\sep\ The depths also trembled, and the clouds dropped water;~\sep

  the heavens of the heaven cried out (\translationliteral{gave a voice}).~\sep\ Your arrows also were flying.~\sep

  The sound (\translationoption{voice}) of Your thunders was in the circuits (\translationoption{spheres});~\sep\ Your lightnings illumined the world.~\sep\ The earth was disturbed and trembled.~\sep

  Your path is in the sea; and Your ways are in the great waters.~\sep\ Your footprints were not perceived (\translationoption{known}).~\sep

  You led Your people like sheep (\translationoption{a flock})~\sep\ by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\markedsunday{Sundays ``after''}{Marmita 49 (118b)}

\begin{halfparskip}
  \Psalm{118b} \acrosticletter{Lamadh} You, O Lord, are forever; and Your word stands firm in the heavens.~\sep

  \liturgicalhint{Alleluia, alleluia, (alleluia). -- First verse.}

  Your faithfulness is to generations;~\sep\ You established the earth and furnished it.~\sep

  But for Your law, which has been my meditation, I would perish in my humiliation.~\sep

  I will never forget Your commandments, for my life is in them.~\sep

  I belong to You; deliver me, for I have kept Your commandments,~\sep

  The wicked have waited for me so that they might destroy me, but I have understood Your testimony.~\sep

  I have seen an end to every uttermost part; but Your commandment is very broad.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Mim} How I love Your law! All day it has been my meditation.~\sep

  Make me wiser than my enemies, for I have kept Your commandments.~\sep

  Give me more understanding than all my teachers, for Your testimony is my meditation.~\sep

  I have more understanding than the elders, for I have kept Your commandments.~\sep

  I have withheld my feet from every evil way,~\sep\ so that I might keep Your commandments.~\sep

  I have not departed from Your judgments, for You have taught me.~\sep

  Your words are sweeter to the roof of my palate than honey to my mouth.~\sep

  I have meditated on Your commandments; therefore I hate the entire path of the wicked.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Nun} Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my paths.~\sep

  I have taken an oath and confirmed it, that I will keep Your righteous judgments.~\sep

  I have been greatly humbled; O Lord, restore my life according to Your word.~\sep

  Be pleased with the words of my mouth, O Lord; and teach me from Your judgments.~\sep

  My soul is always in Your hands; and I have not forgotten Your law.~\sep

  Sinners have placed traps for me; yet I have not departed from Your commandments.~\sep

  I have inherited Your testimony forever, for it is the delight of my heart.~\sep

  I have turned my heart, so that I might practice Your commandments forever in truth.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Simkath} I hate the wicked, but I love Your law.~\sep

  You are my hiding place and my refuge; and I have hoped in Your word.~\sep

  Turn aside from me, wicked ones, so that I may keep the commandments of my God.~\sep

  Confirm me in Your word and I will live; and do not put me to shame because of my hope.~\sep

  Uphold me, and I will be saved; and I will be instructed in Your commandments.~\sep

  I have always rejected (\translationoption{abhorred}) all those who turn aside (\translationoption{err}) from You,~\sep\ for their meditation is wicked.~\sep

  Sustain me and I will be saved; and I will always meditate on Your commandments.~\sep

  My flesh creeps from fear of You; and I stand in awe of Your judgments.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{`E} Doer of justice (\translationoption{judgment}) and righteousness, leave me not in the hand of my oppressors.~\sep

  Delight Your servant with good things, so that the proud may not prevail over (\translationoption{oppress}) me.~\sep

  My eyes look for Your salvation, and for Your righteous promise.~\sep

  Deal with Your servant according to Your mercies; and teach me Your law.~\sep

  I am Your servant; give me understanding, so that I may understand (\translationoption{know}) Your testimony.~\sep

  It is time to serve the Lord. But look! They have made void Your law.~\sep

  Therefore I love Your commandments more than gold, and more than precious stones.~\sep

  I love all Your commandments; and I hate the entire path of the wicked.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Pe} Your testimonies are great; therefore I keep them.~\sep

  Open Your word and give light; and grant understanding to the little children.~\sep

  I opened my mouth and drew breath; and I looked for Your salvation.~\sep

  Turn to me and have mercy on me, for I love Your Name.~\sep

  Establish my steps in Your paths; and may the wicked not prevail against me.~\sep

  Save me from the oppression of man, so that I may keep Your commandments.~\sep

  Cause Your face to shine on Your servant; and teach me Your law.~\sep

  Streams of water come from my eyes, because they have not kept Your law.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Sadhe} You are righteous, O Lord; and very upright are Your judgments.~\sep

  You commanded Your testimony in righteousness and faithfulness (\translationoption{truth}).~\sep

  Zeal has always tortured me, for Your enemies have forgotten Your word.~\sep

  Your word is very pure; and Your servant loves it.~\sep

  I am small and despised; yet I have not forgotten Your commandments.~\sep

  Your righteousness remains forever; and Your law is in truth.~\sep

  Affliction and grief have come on me; but I have meditated on Your commandments.~\sep

  Your testimony is righteous forever; give me understanding, and I will live.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Qoph} I cried to You with all my heart, Lord, hear (\translationoption{answer}) me, and I will keep Your precepts.~\sep

  I have called out to You; save me, and I will keep Your testimony.~\sep

  I rose early in the morning and called out; and looked (\translationoption{waited}) for Your word.~\sep

  My eyes preceded the (night)watch, so that I might meditate on Your word.~\sep

  Hear my voice, O Lord, according to Your mercies; and restore me to life by Your judgments.~\sep

  Those who wickedly persecute me draw near; and they are far removed from Your law.~\sep

  You are near, O Lord; and all Your commandments are in truth;~\sep

  my eyes preceded (\translationoption{prevented}) the (night)watch, so that I might meditate on Your word.~\sep

  Of old have I know Your testimony, for You established it from everlasting.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Rish} Look on my humiliation and deliver me, for I have not forgotten (\translationoption{disregarded}) Your law.~\sep

  Judge my cause (\translationoption{judgment}) and deliver me; restore my life by Your word.~\sep

  Salvation is far from the wicked, for they have not sought Your commandments.~\sep

  Your mercies are many, O Lord; and restore my life by Your judgments.~\sep

  My persecutors and my enemies are numerous; but I have not declined from Your testimony.~\sep

  I have seen the wicked; and I know that they have not kept Your word.~\sep

  See that I love Your commandments, O Lord; restore my life in Your lovingkindness.~\sep

  The beginning of Your word is truth; and all Your righteous judgments are forever.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Shin} Nobles have persecuted me without cause; and my heart stands in awe of Your word.~\sep

  I rejoice in Your word, like one who finds great spoil.~\sep

  I hate and abhor iniquity; but I love Your law.~\sep

  Seven times a day I praise You, because of Your righteous judgments.~\sep

  Great is the peace of those who love Your law; there is no infirmity in them.~\sep

  I have put my hope in Your salvation, O Lord; and I have practised Your commandments.~\sep

  My soul has kept Your testimony;~\sep\ and loved it exceedingly.~\sep

  I have kept Your commandments and Your testimonies; and all my ways are before You.~\sep

  \acrosticletter{Taw} May my song enter before You, O Lord;~\sep\ quicken me by Your word.~\sep

  May my petition enter before You; and deliver me by Your word.~\sep

  May my tongue pour forth Your word [a hymn],~\sep\ for all Your commandments are in righteousness.~\sep

  May my lips speak Your praises, while You teach me Your commandments.~\sep

  May Your hand help me, for I delight in Your commandments.~\sep

  My soul has looked for Your salvation; and I have meditated in Your law.~\sep

  May I live and praise You; as for Your judgment, it will help me.~\sep

  I have wandered like a lost sheep. Seek Your servant,~\sep\ for I have not forgotten Your precepts.

  Glory... --- Alleluia, alleluia, glory to You, O God, alleluia, alleluia, glory to You, O God, alleluia, alleluia, O Lord, have mercy on us.
